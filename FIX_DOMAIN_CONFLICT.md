# 🚨 Domain Conflict: silvercrowdcraft.com pointing to Vercel, not GitHub

## The Problem:
Your DNS is configured correctly, BUT `silvercrowdcraft.com` is currently showing an old Next.js site from **Vercel**, not your new construction management system from **GitHub Pages**.

## 🔧 Solution: Remove Domain from Vercel

### **Step 1: Log in to Vercel**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/login
2. Log in with your account

### **Step 2: Find the Project**
1. Look for a project named something like:
   - `silvercrowdcraft`
   - `silvercrowdcraft-website`
   - or anything related to your plumbing/handyman site

### **Step 3: Remove the Custom Domain**
1. Click on the project
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Click **"Domains"** in the left sidebar
4. Find `silvercrowdcraft.com` in the list
5. Click the **"..." menu** or **"Remove"** button next to it
6. Confirm removal

### **Step 4: Wait & Verify**
1. Wait **5-10 minutes** for DNS to update
2. Check your site: http://silvercrowdcraft.com
3. It should now show your **construction management system**!
