## üìù **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Review the tasks** - Make sure all 10 phases make sense
2. **Check the schedule** - 14 days with 7-person crew realistic?
3. **Add more detail** - I can extract MORE from the blueprints (structural details, electrical circuits, exact dimensions)
4. **Material takeoff** - Want me to count studs, calculate concrete, list all fixtures?
5. **Add more tasks** - I only created 10 main phases. Want me to break down into 50+ detailed tasks?
