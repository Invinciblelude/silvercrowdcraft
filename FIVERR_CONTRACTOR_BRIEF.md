# 3D Model Request - 728 Cordant Drive House

## Project Overview
I need a professional 3D model created from architectural blueprints for a residential house addition project.

---

## What I'm Providing You:

1. **Complete Architectural Blueprint Set (JPG format)**:
   - Floor Plan (Proposed)
   - Foundation Plan
   - Roof Framing Plan
   - Shear Wall Plan
   - Elevations (Front, Rear, Side)
   - All sheets are high-resolution JPG images

2. **Project Details**:
   - **Total Size**: 5,811 square feet (3,200 SF new addition + 2,611 SF existing)
   - **Blueprint Scale**: 1/4" = 1'-0"
   - **Location**: Sacramento, CA
   - **Type**: Single-family residential addition with complex geometry

---

## What I Need From You:

### 1. 3D Model Files
Please deliver the model in **at least 2 of these formats**:
- [ ] **AutoCAD (.dwg or .dxf)** - PREFERRED
- [ ] **SketchUp (.skp)**
- [ ] **Blender (.blend)**
- [ ] **Revit (.rvt)**

### 2. Model Requirements

**MUST Include:**
- ✅ All exterior walls (2x6 studs, 8' height)
- ✅ All interior walls (2x4 and 2x6 per blueprint)
- ✅ Exact room dimensions from blueprint
- ✅ Foundation slab
- ✅ Roof structure (framing per Sheet S-3)
- ✅ All window and door openings (accurate sizes and locations)
- ✅ Correct wall angles (the north wing is rotated ~45°)

**NICE to Have (if within budget):**
- 🏠 Basic materials/textures (stucco exterior, drywall interior)
- 📦 Structural beams (per beam schedule on Sheet S-3)
- 🪟 Actual window/door objects (not just openings)
- 🎨 Rendered images (3-5 exterior views)

### 3. Deliverables

1. **3D Model Files** (in agreed formats)
2. **Walkthrough Video** (2-3 minutes showing interior/exterior)
3. **Screenshots** (5-10 rendered views: exterior, interior rooms, top view)
4. **Quick Reference Guide** - How to open/navigate the model

## ⚠️ Critical Notes:

1. **Complex Geometry**: This is NOT a simple rectangular house. The north wing (Master + Bedroom 3) is ANGLED at approximately 45 degrees. Please pay careful attention to the angles.

2. **Accuracy is Critical**: I need this for construction purposes, so dimensions must match the blueprint exactly.

3. **Vaulted Ceiling**: The Great Room has a vaulted ceiling - this is important for the model.

4. **All Blueprints Provided**: I will send you the complete set of blueprint images after we agree on scope/price.

## Timeline & Budget:

- **My Budget**: $_________ (please quote me)
- **Ideal Timeline**: ______ days
- **Revisions**: I may need 1-2 rounds of minor adjustments

---

## Communication:

- I can provide clarifications on any dimensions
- All blueprints are readable high-resolution JPGs
- I'm available for questions throughout the project

---

## Questions for You:

1. What format(s) can you deliver the model in?
2. Do you include basic materials/textures?
3. How many revision rounds are included?
4. Can you provide a sample of previous blueprint-to-3D work?
5. What's your estimated delivery time?

**Thank you! I look forward to working with you on this project.**
