## üìâ PART 4: LOT-ONLY PROFITABILITY (REALISTIC)

### **Conservative Scenario:**

```
REVENUE (Lot Sales):
8 lots sold =                    $1,211,451

COSTS:
Development (CWE estimates) =     -$679,389
Financing (12mo @ 10%) =           -$67,939
Loan Fees (2%) =                   -$13,588
Sales Commission (4%) =            -$48,458
Legal & Closing =                  -$25,000
Property Taxes (vacant) =          -$18,000
Insurance =                        -$12,000
Marketing to Builders =             -$8,000
Contingency Reserve (3%) =         -$20,377
                                 -----------
TOTAL COSTS =                     -$892,751

NET PROFIT =                      $318,700
ROI =                                 47%
Cash-on-Cash (if 30% down) =         156%
```

### **Base Case Scenario:**

```
REVENUE (mid-range pricing):     $1,300,000

COSTS (same as above):            -$892,751

NET PROFIT =                      $407,249
ROI =                                 60%
```

### **Optimistic Scenario:**

```
REVENUE (higher prices):         $1,393,169

COSTS (same):                     -$892,751

NET PROFIT =                      $500,418
ROI =                                 74%
```

## üè† PART 5: BUILD-OUT STRATEGY (MUCH BETTER PROFITS)

### **Why Building Makes More Sense:**

With thin lot margins ($40K-60K per lot), building captures the real value.

### **Sacramento New Home Market (Current):**

| Home Size | Typical Sale Price | Price/SF | Demand |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| 1,800-2,200 SF | $600K-$750K | $320-$350 | High |
| 2,300-2,800 SF | $750K-$950K | $320-$360 | High |
| 2,900-3,500 SF | $950K-$1.3M | $330-$380 | Medium |

### **Construction Costs (Sacramento 2024-2025):**

| Quality Level | Cost/SF | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| Basic/Starter | $150-$175 | Standard finishes, basic fixtures |
| Mid-Range | $175-$200 | Good finishes, upgraded fixtures |
| Premium | $200-$250 | High-end finishes, custom details |

**Realistic for Volume:** $165-$180/SF

## üí∞ PART 6: BUILD-OUT FINANCIAL MODEL (REALISTIC)

### **Strategy: Build & Sell 8 Homes**

| Lot | Lot Size | Home Size | Build $/SF | Build Cost | Total Cost* | Sale Price | Profit |
|-----|----------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | 4,601 SF | 1,900 SF | $170 | $323,000 | $408,000 | $650,000 | $242,000 |
| 2 | 3,961 SF | 1,800 SF | $170 | $306,000 | $391,000 | $600,000 | $209,000 |
| 3 | 5,761 SF | 2,400 SF | $175 | $420,000 | $505,000 | $820,000 | $315,000 |
| 4 | 5,275 SF | 2,300 SF | $175 | $402,500 | $487,500 | $780,000 | $292,500 |
| 5 | 12,108 SF | 3,200 SF | $180 | $576,000 | $661,000 | $1,100,000 | $439,000 |
| 6 | 10,430 SF | 3,000 SF | $180 | $540,000 | $625,000 | $1,050,000 | $425,000 |
| 7 | 7,006 SF | 2,500 SF | $175 | $437,500 | $522,500 | $850,000 | $327,500 |
| 8 | 7,711 SF | 2,600 SF | $175 | $455,000 | $540,000 | $880,000 | $340,000 |
| **TOTAL** | | **19,700 SF** | **$174** | **$3,460,000** | **$4,140,000** | **$6,730,000** | **$2,590,000** |

*Total Cost = Lot development share ($85K) + Build cost

### **Build-Out Complete Analysis:**

```
TOTAL INVESTMENT:
Subdivision Development =        $679,389
Home Construction (8) =        $3,460,000
Design/Plans/Permits =           $200,000
Financing (24mo @ 10%) =         $434,039
Soft Costs =                     $150,000
Sales Commission (5%) =          $336,500
Contingency (5%) =               $246,196
                               -----------
TOTAL INVESTMENT =             $5,506,124

REVENUE:
8 Homes Sold =                 $6,730,000

NET PROFIT =                   $1,223,876
ROI =                               22.2%
Timeline =                     24-30 months
```

**This is a 3.8X better profit than lot sales!**

## üéØ PART 7: HYBRID STRATEGY (RECOMMENDED)

### **The Smart Play: Mix Both Strategies**

**Phase 1: Develop Lots (Months 0-12)**
- Invest: $679,389
- Complete infrastructure

**Phase 2: Sell Some, Build Some (Month 12+)**
- **Sell 3-4 lots immediately** to builders
- Generate: $400K-550K cash
- **Build 4-5 homes** with lot sale proceeds

### **Hybrid Model Financials:**

```
SELL 3 LOTS:
Lots 2, 4, 7 sold =              $357,324
Cost allocation =                -$254,817
Profit from lot sales =           $102,507

BUILD 5 HOMES:
Investment (lots 1,3,5,6,8) =   $2,585,000
Revenue from sales =            $4,400,000
Profit from homes =             $1,815,000

TOTAL PROFIT =                  $1,917,507
Total Investment =              $3,264,389
ROI =                               58.7%
Timeline =                     24-30 months
```

**Benefits:**
‚úÖ Reduce risk (some lots sold quickly)  
‚úÖ Generate working capital  
‚úÖ Capture building profits  
‚úÖ Test market demand  
‚úÖ Flexible (adjust based on market)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PART 9: CRITICAL RISKS & ISSUES

### **Problem 1: Lot Margins Are Thin**
- Development cost: $85K per lot
- Sale price: $100K-$155K per lot
- Margin: Only $15K-70K per lot
- **Risk:** Any cost overrun = profit wipeout

**Mitigation:**
- Get 3+ contractor bids (CWE might be high)
- Value engineer the scope
- Lock in fixed-price contract
- Secure financing before starting

### **Problem 2: Lot Demand Uncertain**
- Builders might not pay $100K+ per lot
- Market timing risk
- Competition from other lots

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-sell lots to builders BEFORE development
- Get letters of intent (LOIs)
- Build only if can't sell lots profitably

### **Problem 3: High Development Cost**
- $679K seems high for 8 lots
- $577K on-site (might be negotiable)
- Landscaping alone: $124K (seems excessive)

**Mitigation:**
- Get competitive bids
- Consider reducing scope (phase landscaping)
- Negotiate with city on requirements

### **Problem 4: Capital Requirements**
- Need $679K minimum for lots
- Need $3M-5M for building
- Hard to finance without track record

**Mitigation:**
- Find JV partner (they provide $, you manage)
- Builder partnership (50/50 split)
- Wholesale the deal ($50K-100K fee)

## üìû PART 11: IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS

### **This Week:**

1. **Get Competitive Bids**
   - [ ] Contact 3+ civil contractors
   - [ ] Ask for itemized estimates
   - [ ] Compare to CWE's $679K
   - [ ] Target: Get to $550K or less

2. **Pre-Sell Exploration**
   - [ ] Contact 5-10 local builders
   - [ ] Show them the subdivision plan
   - [ ] Ask: "Would you pay $150K-180K for a finished lot?"
   - [ ] Get 2-3 letters of intent

3. **JV Partner Search**
   - [ ] Identify builders with capital
   - [ ] Pitch 50/50 partnership
   - [ ] You manage, they finance construction
   - [ ] Target: Find 1-2 interested partners

4. **Value Engineering**
   - [ ] Review CWE estimates line-by-line
   - [ ] Identify areas to reduce costs
   - [ ] Landscaping: Can it be phased?
   - [ ] Utilities: Any cheaper options?

5. **Market Validation**
   - [ ] Research recent lot sales in Sacramento
   - [ ] Confirm pricing assumptions ($100K-$180K)
   - [ ] Check builder demand (talk to 10+ builders)
   - [ ] Understand competition

---

## üí∞ PART 12: THE BOTTOM LINE

### **Raw Truth:**

**LOT SALES ALONE:** Marginal deal (47-74% ROI, $318K-500K profit)
- Only works if costs reduced OR lots pre-sold at higher prices
- Thin margins = vulnerable to cost overruns
- Not a "home run" deal

**BUILDING HOMES:** Much better (22% ROI but $1.2M profit)
- Requires $5.5M capital (hard to get)
- Higher risk but way higher profit
- Makes sense if you can secure financing

**HYBRID STRATEGY:** Best risk/reward (59% ROI, $1.9M profit)
- Sell some lots for quick cash
- Build homes on others
- Balanced approach
- Recommended path

### **My Honest Assessment:**

This is **NOT a slam-dunk lot development deal** due to:
- ‚ùå High development costs ($85K/lot)
- ‚ùå Moderate lot values ($100K-$180K)
- ‚ùå Thin margins ($15K-$95K per lot)
- ‚ùå Market timing risk

**BUT** it IS a **good opportunity IF:**
- ‚úÖ You can reduce costs to $550K
- ‚úÖ You pre-sell lots at $150K-180K
- ‚úÖ You build homes (capture full value)
- ‚úÖ You find a JV partner (share risk/profit)

### **What Would I Do?**

1. **Get competitive bids** (try to get to $550K)
2. **Pre-sell 2-3 lots** to builders at $160K-180K
3. **Use lot sales** to fund building 5 homes
4. **Target profit:** $1.5M-2M
5. **Timeline:** 24-30 months
6. **Risk level:** Medium (manageable)

---

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**

**DO NOT proceed with lot-only strategy at current costs.**

**EITHER:**
1. Reduce development costs to $550K or less, OR
2. Pre-sell lots at $160K-180K, OR
3. Build homes (hybrid strategy), OR
4. JV with builder (50/50 split), OR
5. Wholesale for $75K-150K fee

**The engineering numbers are accurate, but the business model needs adjustment for this to be a strong deal.**
