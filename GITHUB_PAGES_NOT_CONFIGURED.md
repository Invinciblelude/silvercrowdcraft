# ⚠️ GitHub Pages Not Configured Yet

## The Issue:
You removed the domain from Vercel ✅ (good!), but GitHub Pages hasn't been set up yet, so the site shows "Site not found."

---

## 🔧 Fix: Configure GitHub Pages

### **Go to GitHub Pages Settings:**

1. **Open this URL in your browser:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Invinciblelude/silvercrowdcraft/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Under "Build and deployment" → "Source":**
   - Click the dropdown that says **"None"** or **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Select **"Deploy from a branch"**

3. **Under "Branch":**
   - First dropdown: Select **`main`**
   - Second dropdown: Select **`/docs`**
   - Click **"Save"**

4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to build your site

5. **Refresh the page** - you should see a green banner saying:
   ```
   Your site is live at https://silvercrowdcraft.com/
   ```

## ✅ After It's Live:

### **Enable HTTPS (Important!):**
1. Stay on the same settings page
2. Check the box: **☑️ Enforce HTTPS**
3. Wait a few minutes for SSL certificate to provision

---

## 📋 What You Should See in Settings:

```
✅ Source: Deploy from a branch
✅ Branch: main / docs
✅ Custom domain: silvercrowdcraft.com (verified)
✅ Enforce HTTPS: ☑️
```

---

## ⏱️ Timeline:

- **Step 1-3**: Immediate (your action)
- **GitHub build**: 2-3 minutes
- **DNS fully propagated**: 10-30 minutes
- **HTTPS certificate**: 5-10 minutes after DNS

---

## 🎯 Final Result:

Your site will be live at:
- ✅ **http://silvercrowdcraft.com**
- ✅ **https://silvercrowdcraft.com** (after HTTPS enabled)
- ✅ **https://www.silvercrowdcraft.com**

All showing your **Construction Management System** with 122 tasks, blueprints, and SOPs!
