# Project Prompt: Construction Management System for 728 Cortlandt Drive

## 🏗️ Mission Statement

Transform engineer's Blueprint PDFs into a **Job-Site-Ready Digital Operating Manual** that ensures safety, quality, and schedule adherence. The system must go beyond data extraction to provide actionable, high-value information a foreman and crew need in the field.

## Original Request

I'm a newly promoted foreman building a house (remodel/addition project at 728 Cortlandt Drive, Sacramento CA). I need help organizing the entire construction process from blueprints to completion.

## What I Needed

### 1. Blueprint Organization
- Convert 35-page PDF blueprint into individual JPEG images (300 DPI)
- Automatically classify each page by trade/category:
  - **GENERAL**: Cover sheets, specs, Title 24 compliance
  - **ARCH**: Architectural plans (site, floor, roof, elevations)
  - **STRUCT**: Structural plans (foundation, framing, shear walls, details)
  - **MEP**: Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing plans
- Rename each page with descriptive labels so builders can find what they need:
  - `00-Cover-Index-ProjectInfo.jpg`
  - `07-Proposed-FloorPlan.jpg`
  - `12-Structural-FoundationPlan.jpg`
  - etc.
- Create a web-based blueprint viewer to browse plans by category

### 2. Construction Task List
- Extract every task required to complete the project from the actual blueprints
- Break down by phase: Site Prep → Demo → Foundation → Framing → MEP → Finishes → Closeout
- For each task, specify:
  - **Crew size** needed
  - **Hours** required
  - **Trade** (framing, electrical, plumbing, etc.)
  - **Reference sheets** from the plans
  - **Prerequisites** (what must be done first)
  - **Inspection requirements**
  - **Materials needed**
  - **QC checkpoints**

### 3. Work Schedule
- Create a realistic timeline for a **7-person crew** working **40 hours/week** (Mon-Fri, 7:30 AM - 4:00 PM)
- Start date: **October 27, 2025**
- Show:
  - **Baseline Gantt chart** with all tasks and dependencies
  - **3-week rolling lookahead** (updated weekly)
  - Task assignments by crew member
  - Critical path items

### 4. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- One-page field guides for each construction phase
- Printable checklists with:
  - **Do This**: Step-by-step instructions
  - **Check This**: QC verification points
  - **Done When**: Completion criteria
  - **Safety requirements**
  - **Tools & materials needed**
  - **Common mistakes to avoid**

### 5. Task Dashboard
- Web interface to track progress on every task
- For each task show:
  - Current status (pending/in-progress/completed)
  - Crew assigned
  - Hours logged vs. estimated
  - **Definition of Done** checklist
  - Inspection ID & date
  - Photos uploaded
  - As-built notes
  - Links to relevant plan sheets

### 6. Deployment
- Package everything into a static website
- Deploy to **GitHub Pages** for public access
- Mobile-friendly so crew can view on phones/tablets in the field
- No build tools required—pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## 🎯 Best Practices for Construction Site Management

### 1. Data Extraction & Transformation (Blueprint → Action)

**Granularity and Level of Detail (LOD)**
- ✅ Break down specifications into smallest installable units
  - Example: "Wall assembly" → "Fasten sill plate" → "Install 16" OC studs" → "Add fire blocking" → "Sheath with 5/8" CDX"
- ✅ Provide measurements in both Imperial and Metric units
- ✅ Include exact dimensions with tolerances (e.g., 10'-0" ±1/8")

**Material Specification & Procurement Integration**
- ✅ Cross-reference material call-outs (e.g., "Type X Gypsum") with vendor SKU
- ✅ Specify preferred quantity per task
- ✅ Generate "Just-in-Time" delivery schedule tied to task timeline
- ✅ Link to material catalog with pricing and lead times

**Safety Data Sheet (SDS) & Hazard Association**
- ✅ Automatically associate tasks with required PPE
- ✅ Link to SDS for all materials (solvents, adhesives, lumber treatments)
- ✅ Start every Task SOP with "Safety First" block
- ✅ Flag high-risk tasks (fall protection, confined space, hot work)

### 2. Task Scheduling & Workflow (Job Flow Optimization)

**Dependency Mapping & Rework Prevention**
- ✅ Auto-identify "High-Rework Risk Dependencies"
  - Example: "Don't drywall until all MEP inspections passed"
- ✅ Visualize Critical Path with "Wait-For" flags
- ✅ Highlight predecessor/successor relationships
- ✅ Flag tasks that block multiple downstream activities

**Crew Load Balancing & Skill Allocation**
- ✅ Tag tasks with required skill-set/trade (e.g., "Certified Welder", "Journeyman Plumber")
- ✅ Track crew member certifications
- ✅ Warn if task assigned to unqualified crew member
- ✅ Balance workload across crew to prevent bottlenecks

### 3. Site Quality Assurance (QA/QC)

**Integrated Hold Points & Inspection Gates**
- ✅ Auto-insert hold points based on building codes
  - Examples: "Footing Ready", "Pre-Drywall", "Final MEP"
- ✅ Digital checklist for each inspection derived from code/specs
- ✅ Require photo upload before proceeding to next task
- ✅ Digital sign-off with timestamp and inspector name

**Tolerance and Error Visualization**
- ✅ Display specified tolerance alongside dimension (10'-0" ±1/8")
- ✅ Generate "Measurement Check Diagram" for complex intersections
- ✅ Highlight critical, high-tolerance dimensions
- ✅ Flag out-of-tolerance measurements in red

### 4. User Experience (Foreman-First Design)

**"Five-Minute Morning Huddle" Dashboard**
Must display the 3 most critical pieces of information:
1. **Today's Critical Tasks** (on Critical Path)
2. **Pending Inspections/Hold Points** (blocking work)
3. **Material Arrivals** (today/tomorrow)

**Offline/Low-Connectivity Resilience**
- ✅ All core functions work entirely offline:
  - View blueprints
  - Check SOPs
  - Complete checklists
  - Take photos
- ✅ Robust sync-on-reconnect for all collected data
- ✅ Visual indicator when data pending upload

**Mobile-First Field Interface**
- ✅ Large touch targets (min 44x44 px)
- ✅ High contrast for outdoor visibility
- ✅ Glove-friendly controls
- ✅ Voice notes capability
- ✅ Quick-access to emergency contacts

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Status)
✅ All 27 blueprint pages properly labeled and organized  
✅ 103 construction tasks extracted from plans  
✅ Realistic 8-9 week schedule for 7-person crew  
✅ Web interface accessible on desktop & mobile  
✅ Each task linked to specific plan sheets  
✅ Printable SOPs for field use  
✅ Definition of Done checklist for every task  
✅ Deployed to GitHub Pages with public URL  
✅ Easy to update when plans change

7. **Offline-First Mobile App**
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) with service workers
   - IndexedDB for local storage
   - Background sync when connection restored

8. **Voice Notes & Dictation**
   - Web Speech API for voice input
   - Attach audio notes to tasks
   - Auto-transcribe for searchability

9. **Material SKU Integration**

- ~40 hours total saved over project lifecycle

**Quality Improvements:**
- Zero missed inspections (hold point gates)
- Fewer change orders from misread specs
- Complete as-built documentation with timestamped photos

**Safety Enhancements:**
- PPE requirements displayed before each task
- SDS linked for all hazardous materials
- High-risk tasks flagged for additional precautions

**Cost Avoidance:**

- Just-in-time material delivery reduces storage costs
- Accurate hour estimates prevent cost overruns

### Return on Investment (ROI)

For a typical $500K residential remodel:
- **Setup Cost**: 16 hours × $75/hr = $1,200
- **Time Saved**: 40 hours × $75/hr = $3,000
- **Rework Avoided**: Estimated $8,000
- **Net Benefit**: $9,800 (816% ROI)

*Plus intangible benefits: crew morale, client satisfaction, reputation enhancement*
