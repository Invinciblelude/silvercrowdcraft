# Wall Framing Knowledge Base
## Complete Understanding for Accurate Blueprint-to-Illustration Conversion

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE
**A wall is a structural assembly that transfers roof/floor loads downward to the foundation.**

Every component has a purpose. Understanding WHY tells you HOW to build it correctly.

---

## 📐 PHASE 1: FOUNDATION ATTACHMENT

### Bottom Plate (Sill Plate)
- **Purpose:** Creates a horizontal base that anchors the wall to the foundation
- **Material:** 2x6 (exterior) or 2x4 (interior)
- **Function:** 
  - Distributes wall load evenly across foundation
  - Provides platform for vertical studs
  - Must be pressure-treated if in contact with concrete
- **Connection:** Bolted to foundation with anchor bolts
- **Anchor Bolt Specs (from 728 Cordant):**
  - Size: 5/8" diameter
  - Spacing: Maximum 6'-0" on center
  - Embedment: 7" minimum into concrete
  - How to drill: 11/16" hole through plate (slightly larger than bolt)

**KEY UNDERSTANDING:** Bottom plate is the FIRST thing that happens. Foundation → Plate → Studs.

---

## 🏗️ PHASE 2: VERTICAL STRUCTURE

### Wall Studs
- **Purpose:** Carry vertical loads from roof/floor down to foundation
- **Material:** 2x6 (exterior) or 2x4 (interior)
- **Actual Size:** 
  - "2x6" nominal = 1.5" x 5.5" actual
  - "2x4" nominal = 1.5" x 3.5" actual
- **Spacing:** 16" on center (O.C.)
  - What "16" O.C." means:
    - Measure from CENTER of one stud to CENTER of next stud
    - NOT from edge to edge!
    - 16" spacing allows drywall/sheet goods to land on studs
- **Height:** Standard 8'-0" (96 inches)

**KEY UNDERSTANDING:** Studs are the "bones" - they create the structural framework.

### Stud Layout Mathematics
For a 10'-0" long wall:
- Divide 120" by 16" = 7.5 spacings
- Need 8 studs minimum (one at each end + 6 interior)
- Typical layout: Start 16" from corner, then every 16" thereafter

**Common Stud Count Formula:**
- Short walls (< 10'): Corner studs + at 16" intervals
- Long walls: Exact count = (Length in inches ÷ 16) + 1 (for corner)

---

## 🔗 PHASE 3: HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS

### Top Plates (Double Plate)
- **Purpose:** 
  - Ties multiple walls together
  - Provides load distribution across wall
  - Prevents wall buckling
- **Material:** Double 2x6 (exterior) or 2x4 (interior)
- **Installation:** Two boards STACKED on top of studs
- **Why Double:**
  - Bottom plate overlaps top of studs → provides transfer surface
  - Top plate extends beyond corners → ties adjacent walls together
  - Continuity across door/window openings

**KEY UNDERSTANDING:** Top plate creates horizontal continuity - walls become a unified system.

---

## 🪟 PHASE 4: OPENINGS (Doors & Windows)

### Headers
- **Purpose:** Carry the load ABOVE an opening (what studs can't do because they're interrupted)
- **Location:** Horizontal beam at top of opening
- **Sizing Rule of Thumb:**
  - Small openings (≤ 3'): 2x6 or 2x8 header
  - Medium (3'-6'): 2x10 or 2x12 header
  - Large (6'+): Consult structural engineer or beam schedule
  - Your blueprints will specify exact sizes

**How Headers Work:**
```
Weight of roof/floor above → Transfers to header → Header transfers to King Studs → Down to foundation
```

### King Studs
- **Purpose:** Full-height studs on EACH SIDE of an opening
- **Function:** Carries the load that header transfers
- **Material:** Same as wall studs (2x6 or 2x4)
- **Installation:** Goes from bottom plate to top plate, adjacent to opening

### Jack Studs (Trimmer Studs)
- **Purpose:** Supports the header directly
- **Material:** Same as wall studs
- **Height:** Shorter - from bottom plate to bottom of header
- **Installation:** Between king stud and header, typically 1-2 jacks per side
- **Why Needed:** Header sits ON the jack studs (gravity load transfer)

### Cripple Studs
- **Purpose:** Fills in above and below openings
- **Location:** 
  - Above header (between header and top plate)
  - Below sill plate (between sill and bottom plate) - less common
- **Function:** Maintains stud spacing, provides nailing for drywall
- **Installation:** Space at 16" O.C. like regular studs

### Rough Opening (R.O.) Dimensions
- **Total Opening** = Actual window/door size + shrinkage
- **Typical Shrinkage:**
  - Window: Add 1" width, 1/2" height
  - Door: Add 2" width, 2-1/2" height (for threshold)
- **Example:** 3'-0" x 4'-0" window
  - Rough opening = 37" wide x 48.5" tall
  - Header spans 37" + king stud widths

**KEY UNDERSTANDING:** Every opening weakens the wall. Headers + king/jack studs redistribute the load around the opening.

---

## 🛡️ PHASE 5: SHEATHING & PROTECTION

### Exterior Sheathing (OSB/Plywood)
- **Purpose:** 
  - Provides lateral strength (resists wind/earthquake forces)
  - Weather barrier base
  - Creates continuous structural diaphragm
- **Material (728 Cordant spec):** 15/32" OSB
- **Installation:** 
  - Horizontal layout (long side perpendicular to studs)
  - Stagger vertical seams
  - Gap 1/8" between sheets for expansion
  - Nails: 6d @ 6" edges, 12" field (typical)
- **Coverage:** Entire exterior wall surface

**KEY UNDERSTANDING:** Sheathing turns individual studs into a unified structural wall system.

### Insulation
- **Material:** R-19 fiberglass batts (728 Cordant spec)
- **Purpose:** Thermal barrier
- **Installation:** Fits between studs
- **Note:** NOT structural, but required by code

### Interior Drywall
- **Material:** 1/2" standard gypsum board
- **Installation:** Vertical or horizontal, nails @ 16" OC
- **Coverage:** Entire interior wall surface

## 🔨 CONSTRUCTION SEQUENCE (THE ORDER MATTERS!)

### Step-by-Step Wall Assembly:

**STEP 1: Layout**
- Snap chalk lines on foundation showing wall locations
- Mark anchor bolt positions
- Mark all openings (windows/doors)

**STEP 2: Bottom Plate**
- Cut plate to length
- Drill holes for anchor bolts (11/16" holes)
- Install on foundation, tight against chalk line
- Square corners using 3-4-5 triangle

**STEP 3: Cut Studs**
- All studs cut to same length (8'-0" minus plates = 96" - 5.5" = 90.5" for 2x6)
- Mark layout on plate @ 16" intervals

**STEP 4: Assemble Wall Flat**
- Lay bottom plate on slab/ground
- Position studs on 16" centers
- Install double top plate
- Square wall using diagonal measurements
- Brace temporarily

**STEP 5: Tip Wall Up**
- Lift entire assembly into place
- Align over bottom plate on foundation
- Attach to foundation with anchor bolts
- Level and plumb wall
- Brace to adjacent walls or ground

**STEP 6: Openings**
- Cut studs for rough openings
- Install headers, king studs, jack studs
- Install cripples
- Verify rough opening dimensions

**STEP 7: Sheathing**
- Apply OSB to exterior
- Nail per schedule
- Install house wrap (WRB)

**STEP 8: Insulation**
- Install batts between studs
- Full thickness coverage

**STEP 9: Drywall**
- Hang drywall
- Tape and finish

## 📊 READING BLUEPRINT SPECIFICATIONS

### What Each Symbol/Note Means:

**Wall Lines:**
- Thick solid line = Exterior wall (bearing)
- Thin solid line = Interior wall (non-bearing)
- Double line = Wall thickness shown

**Dimensions:**
- 10'-6" = 10 feet, 6 inches
- @ 16" O.C. = on center, measured from center to center
- R.O. = Rough opening

**Annotations:**
- "TYP" = Typical (applies to all locations unless noted otherwise)
- "SEE SCHEDULE" = Details in separate table
- Cntr (Center) = From centerline, not edge

### Example Reading a Wall Detail:
```
EXTERIOR WALL: 2x6 @ 16" O.C., 15/32" OSB, R-19, 5/8" Anchor @ 6'-0" Max
```

**Translation:**
- Use 2x6 studs
- Space them 16" from center to center
- Sheath with 15/32" thick OSB
- Install R-19 insulation
- Bolt with 5/8" anchors, max 6 feet apart

## ⚠️ CRITICAL COMMON MISTAKES

### Mistake #1: Wrong Stud Spacing
**Error:** Measuring from edge to edge instead of center to center
**Result:** Studs don't align with sheet goods, drywall doesn't land on studs
**Fix:** Always measure from CENTER of one stud to CENTER of next

### Mistake #2: Missing Jack Studs
**Error:** Header sitting on king stud alone
**Result:** Insufficient support, header sags
**Fix:** Always install jack studs to support header ends

### Mistake #3: Wrong Rough Opening
**Error:** Opening too small for window/door
**Result:** Window/door won't fit, have to reframe
**Fix:** Always add shrinkage (typically 1-2" wider than unit)

### Mistake #4: Single Top Plate
**Error:** Using only one top plate board
**Result:** Adjacent walls don't tie together properly
**Fix:** Always use DOUBLE top plates

### Mistake #5: Not Squaring Walls
**Error:** Assuming corners are square
**Result:** Windows don't open, doors bind, aesthetic issues
**Fix:** Use 3-4-5 triangle method to verify square

## 📝 CONCLUSION

**Understanding framing = Understanding force flow**

Load travels: Roof → Top Plates → Studs → Bottom Plate → Foundation

Every component has a purpose. Every connection matters. Reading blueprints correctly means understanding what each specification does for the structural system.

When you can visualize HOW forces move through the assembly, you can create ACCURATE illustrations that show the REALITY of construction, not just generic symbols.
