### **OPTION 3: Hybrid Partnership (My Favorite!)**

**Strategy:** Develop lots first, then partner decides to build or sell

#### **Phase 1: Lot Development ($929K)**
```
Partner invests:         $929,000
Timeline:                12-15 months
Create:                  8 finished lots

DECISION POINT:
Option A: Sell all lots → Exit with profit
Option B: Build 4-6 homes → Continue partnership
Option C: Hybrid → Sell some, build some
```

#### **Phase 2A: If Market is Strong (Sell Lots)**
```
Sell 8 lots:           $1,400,000 (if pre-sold well)
Costs:                   -$929,000
                        -----------
Profit:                  $471,000
Partner gets (50%):      $235,500
ROI:                     25.4%
IRR (15mo):              20.3%

LOW RISK EXIT ✅
```

#### **Phase 2B: If Market is Hot (Build Homes)**
```
Sell 3-4 lots for:       $500,000 (generate capital)
Use proceeds to build 4-5 homes
Additional investment:  $2,500,000
Revenue (5 homes):      $4,200,000
                       -----------
Additional Profit:      $1,200,000
Partner gets (50%):       $600,000

Total Partner Profit:    $835,500
Total Investment:      $3,429,000
Total ROI:               24.4%
IRR (30mo):              11.7%

HIGHER PROFIT ✅
```

#### **Benefits of Hybrid:**
- ✅ Decision point after Phase 1 (test market)
- ✅ Lower initial risk (smaller investment)
- ✅ Flexibility to pivot based on market
- ✅ Partner can exit or continue
- ✅ De-risked by time you decide to build

## 🎯 NEGOTIATION STRATEGIES

### **If Partner Wants More Than 50%:**

**Response:**
```
"I understand you're providing most of the capital. However, I'm 
bringing significant value:

• Land/entitlements worth $100K-200K
• 500+ hours of my time (project management)
• De-risked opportunity (75% through entitlements)
• I'm taking entrepreneurial risk

Could we structure it as:
• 60/40 split (You/Me) on first $500K profit
• 50/50 split on profit above $500K
This way you get preferential returns, but I'm rewarded for the 
heavy lifting and entrepreneurship."
```

### **If Partner Wants Control:**

**Response:**
```
"I'm happy to give you approval rights on major decisions (budget, 
contractors, sale prices). However, I need to manage day-to-day 
operations since this is my primary focus.

Let's define:
• Major decisions (we both approve)
• Minor decisions (I execute)
• Monthly check-ins for transparency

This ensures efficiency while giving you appropriate oversight."
```

### **If Partner is Nervous About Risk:**

**Response:**
```
"I appreciate your caution. Let me propose a de-risking strategy:

Phase 1: $100K earnest money (test the process)
• Use it for final engineering, permits
• If it goes well, proceed to full funding
• If issues arise, we reassess

OR

Tiered funding:
• Tranche 1: $300K (initial work)
• Milestone: permits issued
• Tranche 2: $629K (complete development)

This way you can see progress before full commitment."
```
