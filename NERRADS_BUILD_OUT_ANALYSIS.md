## üéØ HYBRID STRATEGY (RECOMMENDED)

### **Phased Approach:**

**Phase 1: Develop Lots (Months 0-12)**
- Invest: $679K
- Complete subdivision infrastructure
- Get 8 finished lots ready

**Phase 2: Decision Point (Month 12)**
- **Option 2A:** Sell 4-6 lots to builders immediately
  - Generate: $1.0M-1.5M cash
  - Use proceeds to fund Phase 3

- **Option 2B:** Pre-sell lots to lock in buyers
  - Reduce risk
  - Confirm market demand

**Phase 3: Build on Remaining Lots (Months 12-30)**
- Use lot sale proceeds to fund construction
- Build 2-4 spec homes
- Reduce your capital requirement
- Test the retail market
- Keep some lots for sale if home market weakens

### **Hybrid Financial Model:**

```
Sell 4 lots to builders:
  4 √ó $250K = $1,000,000

Build 4 homes:
  Investment: $1,900,000 (build cost + soft costs)
  Using: $1M from lot sales + $900K new capital
  Revenue: $3,900,000 (4 homes)
  Profit on homes: $2,000,000

TOTAL PROFIT:
  Lot sales profit: $325,000 (4 lots minus costs)
  Home sales profit: $2,000,000 (4 homes)
  TOTAL: $2,325,000

Total Capital Required: $1,579,389 ($679K + $900K)
ROI: 147%
Timeline: 24-30 months
Risk: Medium (balanced approach)
```

## üìà MARKET ANALYSIS - SACRAMENTO HOME PRICES

### Current Sacramento Market (2024):

| Home Size | Typical Price | Price/SF | Sales Velocity |
|-----------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| 1,800-2,200 SF | $650K-850K | $330-385/SF | Fast (30-45 days) |
| 2,300-2,800 SF | $850K-1.1M | $350-400/SF | Medium (45-60 days) |
| 2,900-3,500 SF | $1.1M-1.5M | $370-430/SF | Slower (60-90 days) |

### North Sacramento Submarket:
- **High demand** from families
- **Good schools** in area
- **Strong appreciation** (5-7% annually)
- **Low inventory** (undersupplied)
- **Builder activity** (active new construction)

**Absorption Rate:** 2-3 homes per month in comparable subdivisions

---

## üèóÔ∏è CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE (If Building)

### Per Home (Typical):
- **Months 1-2:** Final plans, permits
- **Months 3-4:** Foundation, framing
- **Months 5-6:** Rough-ins (MEP)
- **Months 7-8:** Drywall, finishes
- **Month 9:** Final inspections
- **Month 10:** Close & deliver

### 8 Homes (Staggered):
- Start 2 homes every 3 months
- Rolling construction
- First home ready: Month 10
- Last home ready: Month 24
- All homes sold: Month 30-36

---

## üí∞ FINANCING OPTIONS FOR BUILD-OUT

### Option 1: Construction Loan (Traditional)
```
Loan Type: Spec Construction Loan
Loan Amount: 75% of project cost = $4.3M
Your Equity: 25% = $1.4M
Interest Rate: 8-10%
Term: Interest-only during construction
Converts to: Take-out loan or pay off at sale
```

### Option 2: Builder Partnership
```
Structure: You provide lots, builder provides construction
Deal: 50/50 profit split or fixed lot price
Your Investment: $679K (lots only)
Builder Investment: $3.7M (construction)
Profit Split: 50/50 on each home sale
Your Profit: $1M-1.5M
```

### Option 3: Pre-Sale Model
```
Strategy: Pre-sell homes before building
Buyer deposits: 5-10% down
Use deposits: For initial construction costs
Builder risk: Minimized (buyers committed)
Your risk: Very low
```

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

### **START WITH LOT SALES:**

**Why:**
1. ‚úÖ **Proof of Concept** - Test market demand
2. ‚úÖ **Lower Risk** - $679K vs $5.7M investment
3. ‚úÖ **Faster Returns** - 12-18 months vs 36 months
4. ‚úÖ **Generate Capital** - Use profits for next projects
5. ‚úÖ **Less Complexity** - No home construction management
6. ‚úÖ **Market Timing** - Exit before potential downturn

**Then Consider Building:**
- After lot sales, if market is strong
- If you find great builder partnerships
- If you have access to construction capital
- If you want to maximize total returns

---

## üìä RISK COMPARISON

| Risk Factor | Lot Sales | Build & Sell |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Capital Risk** | Low ($679K) | High ($5.7M) |
| **Market Risk** | Low (short timeline) | Medium (2-3 year exposure) |
| **Construction Risk** | None | High (delays, overruns) |
| **Permitting Risk** | Low (mostly done) | Medium (home permits) |
| **Sales Risk** | Low (builder demand) | Medium (retail market) |
| **Management Complexity** | Low | High |
| **Overall Risk** | **LOW-MEDIUM** | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |

---

## üí° KEY TAKEAWAYS

### **The $679K Question:**
- ‚úÖ **YES** - Accurate for subdivision development
- ‚úÖ **NO** - Not enough to build houses
- ‚úÖ **Strategy** - Start with lot sales, consider building later

### **Your $150/SF Question:**
- ‚úÖ Correct! Houses cost $150-200/SF to build
- ‚úÖ That's $350K-700K per home
- ‚úÖ Total project: $679K (lots) + $3.7M (homes) = $4.4M
- ‚úÖ Makes sense now!

### **Best Path Forward:**
1. **Invest $679K** - Develop subdivision
2. **Sell lots** - Generate $2M revenue, $1.1M profit
3. **Use profits** - Fund next project or build homes
4. **Scale business** - Reinvest and grow

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

### If Pursuing Lot Sales (Recommended):
1. ‚úÖ Finalize permits
2. ‚úÖ Secure $679K financing
3. ‚úÖ Start construction
4. ‚úÖ Market to builders (pre-sell if possible)
5. ‚úÖ Collect $1.1M profit

### If Considering Build-Out:
1. ‚úÖ Complete lot development first
2. ‚úÖ Sell 2-4 lots to generate capital
3. ‚úÖ Use proceeds to fund spec homes
4. ‚úÖ Partner with experienced builder
5. ‚úÖ Start with 1-2 homes (test market)
6. ‚úÖ Scale if successful

---

**BOTTOM LINE:** 

Your engineering estimates ($679K) are **100% accurate** for subdivision development. 

If you want to ALSO build homes, add $3.7M-4.5M for construction.

**My recommendation:** Start with lot sales (lower risk, faster profit), then consider building if market conditions are favorable!
