I'm offering EARLY ACCESS before public marketing.

Can we schedule a 15-min call this week?

[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

```

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email about the 8-lot opportunity in North Sacramento.

I've attached the site plan and pricing sheet.

Still interested? If not, would you know of anyone who might be?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

---

### **Template 3: Follow-Up (Interested)**

```
Subject: RE: Sacramento Lots - Due Diligence Package

‚Ä¢ Site plan and lot sizes
‚Ä¢ Engineering reports (CWE)
‚Ä¢ Market analysis
‚Ä¢ Pricing and terms
‚Ä¢ Development timeline

Let me know what questions you have. Available for a site visit anytime.

## üìû CALL SCRIPTS

### **Cold Call Script:**

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I'm calling about a lot development 
opportunity in North Sacramento. Do you have a quick minute?

[If YES...]

Great! We're developing 8 residential lots off North Ave, and I'm offering 
early access to a few builders before we go to market. The lots range from 
4,000 to 12,000 square feet, and they'll be ready to build in about 12 months.

Are you actively looking for lots in the Sacramento area?"

[If YES ‚Üí Schedule follow-up call]
[If NO ‚Üí Ask for referrals]
```

---

### **Follow-Up Call Script:**

```
"Hi [Name], just following up on the email I sent about the Sacramento lots. 
Did you have a chance to review?

[If YES...]
Great! What questions can I answer?

[If NO...]
No problem. The key points are: 8 lots, North Sacramento, 75% entitled, 
ready in 12 months, priced $140K-$240K. Would it help if I sent the site 
plan and details?

Can we schedule a quick 15-minute call to discuss?"
```

---

## üéØ OBJECTION RESPONSES

### **"Price is too high"**
```
"I understand. These are priced at $20-24/SF, which is 10-15% below current 
market comps in Sacramento. Plus, you're locking in pricing now and getting 
first choice. What price range works for your pro forma?"

[Negotiate or move on]
```

---

### **"I'll wait until they're ready"**
```
"That's an option, but by pre-purchasing now you get:
1. First choice of lots
2. Locked-in pricing (hedge inflation)
3. Time to plan your home designs
4. Only 10% down, balance at closing

The trade-off is if you wait, pricing will be 10-15% higher and best lots 
may be gone. Sound fair?"
```

---

### **"I need to see them first"**
```
"Absolutely! The site is accessible now - when works for you?

I'll bring the site plan, engineering drawings, and we can walk the property 
together. How about [Day] at [Time]?"
```
