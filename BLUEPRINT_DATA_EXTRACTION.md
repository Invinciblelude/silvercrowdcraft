## NEXT STEPS FOR 3D MODELING

To create an ACCURATE 3D model, use this extracted data as follows:

1. **Set Scale**: 1/4" = 1'-0" in your modeling software
2. **Foundation Level**: Set at elevation 100.00 (datum)
3. **Wall Heights**: 8'-0" for standard rooms, vaulted for Great Room
4. **Trace Floor Plan**: Use exact dimensions listed above
5. **Extrude Walls**: Vertical extrusion to 8'-0" (or vault height)
6. **Add Roof**: Use beam schedule and rafter spacing from S-3
7. **Place Openings**: Windows and doors per schedule
8. **Apply Finishes**: Stucco exterior, drywall interior (from elevation notes)
