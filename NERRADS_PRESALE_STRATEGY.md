# üéØ NERRADSCALI SUBDIVISION - Pre-Sale Strategy
## Lock in Buyers BEFORE Development Starts

---

## üöÄ WHY PRE-SELLING IS CRITICAL

**The Problem:**
- Development cost: $679,389
- Market lot prices: $87K-$242K
- Margin per lot: Only $15K-$70K
- **Risk:** Cost overruns wipe out profit

**The Solution:**
- Pre-sell 2-4 lots BEFORE starting development
- Lock in prices at $150K-$180K (above market)
- Builders pay premium for certainty
- You reduce risk dramatically

**Benefits:**
‚úÖ Guaranteed buyers (no market risk)  
‚úÖ Higher prices (scarcity premium)  
‚úÖ Easier financing (pre-sales = collateral)  
‚úÖ Cash flow during development  
‚úÖ Proof of concept for remaining lots  

---

## üí∞ PRE-SALE FINANCIAL MODEL

### **Target: Pre-Sell 3 Lots**

```
Lots to Pre-Sell:
Lot 2 (3,961 SF) @ $160/SF = $160,000

Lot 7 (7,006 SF) @ $180/SF = $180,000
                            ----------
TOTAL PRE-SALES:            $510,000

Pre-Sale Deposits (10%):     $51,000 (immediate)
Balance at Closing:         $459,000 (month 12)

IMPACT ON PROJECT:
Total revenue increased by:  $100,000-$150,000
Risk reduced by:            60-70%
Financing easier:           Pre-sales = collateral

**Opening:**
```
Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company]. I'm calling about a 
subdivision development in North Sacramento - do you have a quick minute?

[If YES, continue...]

Great! I'll keep this brief. We're developing 8 residential lots off 
North Ave near I-5, and I'm offering early access to a few select builders 
before we go to market.

The lots range from 4,000 to 12,000 square feet, fully entitled, and 
we're targeting delivery in about 12 months.

Are you actively looking for lots in the Sacramento area?
```

**If Interested:**
```
Excellent. Here's what I'd suggest:

1. I'll email you the site plan and pricing today
2. You review over the next 2-3 days
3. We schedule a 30-minute call to discuss specifics
4. If it makes sense, we move to LOI stage

Sound good?

What's the best email for you?
```

**If Not Interested:**
```
No problem. Would you know of any other builders in the area who might 
be interested in finished lots?

## üí° OBJECTION HANDLING

### **Objection: "Price is too high"**
**Response:**
"I understand. Let me show you the market data. Finished lots in this area are 
selling for $20-25/SF. I'm offering $24/SF with the benefit of locking in now 
before any price increases. Plus, by pre-buying, you're getting first choice 
and can start planning your designs immediately. What price would work for you?"

### **Objection: "I need to see the lots first"**
**Response:**
"Absolutely, I'd expect nothing less. The lots aren't developed yet - we're 
starting construction in 60 days. What I can show you is the site plan, 
engineering drawings, and we can walk the property together. Would next 
Tuesday or Thursday work?"

### **Objection: "I'll wait until they're finished"**
**Response:**
"That's certainly an option. The trade-off is that by waiting, you'll likely 
pay 10-15% more and won't have first choice. I have 2 other builders reviewing 
this week. If you want to lock in pricing and lot selection, this week is the 
time. If not, I completely understand, but the early-bird pricing won't be 
available later."

### **Objection: "What if you don't finish?"**
**Response:**
"Great question. You'll have full title insurance and we'll include completion 
guarantees in the contract. Your deposit is fully refundable if we don't 
deliver per the agreed timeline and specifications. Plus, we're 75% through 
entitlements already - this isn't a speculative project."

### **Objection: "I don't know the area well"**
**Response:**
"I can help with that. This is North Sacramento, near I-5 - good access, 
established neighborhood. I've pulled comps showing homes selling for $650K-1M 
in the area. Would it help if I sent you a market analysis package?"
