  notes: [],
  photos: []
}
```

## 🎯 Key Features Detail

### YouTube Search Integration
- Add interactive search bar to each SOP
- Search for: "[Task name] construction how to"
- Embedded search results
- No hardcoded video links (they break)

### Image Compression

- Max width: 800px
- Format: JPEG
- Quality: 70%
- Show before/after file sizes

## 📝 Content Generation

### Task Hour Estimation
Use realistic industry standards:
- Site prep: 2-5 hrs per 100 SF
- Foundation: 40-80 hrs per 1000 SF
- Framing: 3-5 hrs per wall section
- Electrical rough-in: 1 outlet = 0.5-1 hr
- Plumbing rough-in: 1 fixture = 2-3 hrs
- Drywall: 1-2 hrs per sheet
- Painting: 200 SF per hr

Calculate realistic timeline based on:
- 40-hour work weeks
- 8-hour work days
- Multiple trades working simultaneously
- Weather delays, inspections, material delivery

### SOP Detail Level
Each SOP should be:
- 500-1500 words
- 10-30 detailed steps
- Include measurements and specifications
- Reference code requirements
- List quality checkpoints
- Warn of common errors

## 🔐 Security Setup

### Password Protection
```javascript
const SITE_PASSWORD = "YourProjectPassword2024";
const AUTH_DURATION = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours
```

Protect these pages:
- Dashboard
- Project/Tasks
- Blueprints
- Schedules
- Changelog

Public pages:
- Login/Landing
- Logout (but don't display password!)

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

- iPhone (Safari)
- Android (Chrome)
- iPad/Tablets
- Desktop browsers

Features:
- Touch-friendly buttons (44px minimum)
- Responsive images
- Collapsible sections
- Horizontal scrolling for schedules
- Readable font sizes (16px minimum)

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages
- Push to GitHub repository
- Enable GitHub Pages from `docs/` folder
- Add custom domain (optional)
- Include `.nojekyll` file
- Set up branch protection

### Custom Domain
- Configure DNS settings
- Add CNAME file
- Verify domain ownership
- Enable HTTPS

## 📖 Documentation Needed

Create these files:
1. **README.md** - Project overview, features, setup
2. **PASSWORD_INFO.md** - Password management, security
3. **TESTING_CHECKLIST.md** - QA procedures, test cases
4. **SITE_READY.md** - Deployment guide, live URLs
5. **PHOTO_STORAGE_GUIDE.md** - Storage limitations, database options
6. **SESSION_SUMMARY.md** - Development progress, changes
7. **CHANGELOG.md** - User-facing version history
8. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Commands, URLs, important info

## 🎓 Learning Features

### Training Integration
- YouTube search bars in every SOP
- Links to code requirements
- Safety data sheets (SDS) references
- Industry best practices
- Quality standards

### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress indicators
- Percentage complete by phase
- Hours logged vs estimated

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Storage Limitations
- localStorage is limited (~5MB)
- Good for 10-20 compressed photos per browser
- Each browser/device has separate storage
- For production with multiple workers, recommend database:
  - Firebase (free tier, then $5-25/month)
  - Supabase (free tier, then $25/month)
  - AWS S3 + DynamoDB

### Blueprint Handling
- Large blueprints can slow performance
- Compress to reasonable size (200-500KB per sheet)
- Use progressive JPEG or optimized PNG
- Consider lazy loading

### Browser Compatibility
- Test in multiple browsers
- Use standard JavaScript (ES6 ok)
- Avoid experimental features
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers

## 🎁 Bonus Features (Optional)

If time permits, add:
- **Export functionality** - Download data as JSON/CSV
- **Print views** - Printer-friendly task lists
- **QR codes** - Quick access to specific tasks
- **Voice notes** - Audio recording capability
- **Weather integration** - Outdoor work planning
- **Material cost tracking** - Budget management
- **Worker assignments** - Task ownership
- **Time tracking** - Clock in/out per task
- **Inspection checklists** - Quality assurance
- **Document uploads** - Permits, warranties, etc.

## 💡 Tips for AI Assistant

1. **Start with the generator script** - Build the Python script to create tasks and SOPs first
2. **Use realistic data** - Don't underestimate hours or over-simplify tasks
3. **Match blueprints carefully** - Link tasks to the correct drawing sheets
4. **Test frequently** - Check that data persists, photos compress, etc.
5. **Mobile first** - Design for phone screens primarily
6. **Keep it simple** - Vanilla JavaScript is fine, no need for frameworks
7. **Document as you go** - Create README, guides, etc. during development
8. **Security matters** - Don't expose passwords in public files
9. **Performance counts** - Compress images, optimize code
10. **Think like a worker** - Make it intuitive for construction crews

---

## 🔄 For My Next Project

Just provide me with:
1. New blueprint files
2. New project address and details
3. Any special requirements or changes
4. Desired features from the bonus list

And you can build a complete construction management system following this same pattern!
