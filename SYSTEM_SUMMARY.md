- Click the card → see all tasks by trade
- Click any task → see full SOP with instructions
- Click blueprint links → view relevant sheets

### 2. **Daily Workflow**
1. Start at **Projects Dashboard** (index.html)
2. Click your project (728 Cortlandt)
3. Filter tasks by current phase (e.g., "Foundation")
4. Click the task you're starting today
5. Review the SOP completely before beginning work
6. Follow step-by-step instructions
7. Check QC checkpoints as you go

## 🎯 What Makes This Efficient

### ✅ Clear Hierarchy
- Start broad (all projects) → zoom in (one project) → drill down (specific task) → see details (SOP)

### ✅ Task-Centric
- Everything revolves around tasks
- Each task has everything you need:
  - What to do (steps)
  - What you need (materials/tools)
  - How to stay safe (PPE/warnings)
  - How to verify quality (QC checks)
  - What blueprints to reference

### ✅ Context-Aware
- Blueprint pages are automatically linked to relevant tasks
- Prerequisites prevent doing things out of order
- Inspection milestones ensure code compliance

### ✅ Field-Ready
- Works offline (no internet needed on site)
- Mobile-optimized (use on phone/tablet)
- Dark theme (easy to read in bright sun)
- Large buttons (easy with gloves on)

## 📦 What Was Cleaned Up

**Removed old files**:
- `SOP.html` (replaced with sops/ directory)
- `SOP_detailed.md` (content moved to individual SOPs)
- `SOP_quick.md` (content moved to individual SOPs)
- `tasks.html` (replaced with project.html)
- `tasks.csv` / `tasks.json` (replaced with project_tasks.json)
- `dashboard.html` (replaced with index.html)
- `printables/` directory (no longer needed)
- `task_sops/` directory (replaced with sops/)

**Old blueprint images** (UUID-named JPEGs) were replaced with properly named images extracted from the PDF.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):
1. **Preview the site**: http://127.0.0.1:8088
2. **Test the flow**: Dashboard → Project → Task → SOP → Blueprint
3. **Review a few SOPs**: Make sure instructions are clear
4. **Provide feedback**: Anything unclear or missing?

### This Week:
1. **Start using it on site**: Load on your phone/tablet
2. **Add photos**: As tasks complete, add progress photos
3. **Track hours**: Log actual hours vs estimated
4. **Log problems**: Use the 🎤 button for issues

### Soon:
1. **Push to GitHub**: Deploy for crew access
2. **Add more projects**: Scale to multiple job sites
3. **Crew logins**: Track who did what
4. **Material ordering**: Link to suppliers/SKUs
