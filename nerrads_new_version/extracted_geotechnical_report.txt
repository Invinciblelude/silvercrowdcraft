INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF STUDY
This report presents the results of our Geotechnical Engineering Study for the proposed improvements
to be designed and constructed on the above referenced subject site (refer to the Location Plan, Figure
1, Appendix A). The purpose of the study is to evaluate the general conditions of the earth materials at
the site to provide conclusions and recommendations related to the geotechnical and geological aspects
of the project as discussed in our proposal / agreement of February 9, 2022, and executed February 10,
2022.
The scope of our work included a site reconnaissance, review of client provided and readily available
published documents (including aerial images, topographic maps, and nearby groundwater levels),
exploring and sampling the general subsurface earth and groundwater conditions, performing soil
mechanics laboratory tests, assessing potential for geological hazards (including liquefaction and
expansive soil conditions), performing geotechnical analysis, and making recommendations for
earthwork, foundation design, lateral resistance, floor slab-on-grade support, and on-site pavements.
The attached Appendices contain further information including graphic presentations (Site Vicinity Map
and Map of Explorations - Appendix A); field exploration procedures and logs of subsurface explorations
(Appendix B); laboratory testing and procedures used (Appendix C); Guide Specifications for Earthwork
(Appendix D); and SEAOC/OSHPD U.S. Seismic Design Maps (Appendix E).
PROJECT LOCATION
The project is proposed on a 1.32+/- acre residential parcel (APN: 237-020-009-200). The subject site is
bounded by North Avenue to the south, residential properties to the east and west, and City of
Sacramento easement and I-80 to the North.

PROPOSED PROJECT INFORMATION
In preparing this report we reviewed the grading plan by RFE Engineering, Inc. January 24, 2022, “On-
Site Improvement Plans” (Sheet No. C6), and reviewed Google Earth aerial photography (5/14/2021)
related to the subject site. Based on the referenced plan and information provided by the client, the
proposed project consists of the design and construction of one (1) single-family residential home with
a footprint area of 1,700 +/- square feet, four (4) half plex’s with footprints of 1,150+/- square feet and
two (2) half plex’s with footprints of 1,280 +/- square feet. A stormwater detention pond is proposed in
the northeastern portion of the site. The proposed improvements also include landscaping, concrete
driveways, asphalt driving aisles, paved parking area and on-site concrete sidewalks.
FINDINGS
SITE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Google Earth aerial images dating back to May 1993 indicate the site and surrounding properties
appeared as described in the Site Description section below and Project Location section above.
SITE DESCRIPTION
During our site visit, the subject site was relatively flat lying with minor surface elevation changes. The
eastern portion of the parcel was vacant and covered with volunteer grasses. A dense cluster of trees
was in the northeastern portion of the site as well as metal scraps and various other debris. A single-
story residential home enclosed by a wooden fence was in the southwestern portion of the parcel. In
the northeastern corner of the site was a tower supporting southerly trending high tension electric lines.
Two concrete slabs were in the northwestern portion of the site. Overall drainage of the subject site
trended generally to the north toward a canal.
GEOLOGY AND SEISMICITY
The site is located within California's Great Valley Geomorphic Province, a geologically young, large, flat-
lying alluvial plain in the central portion of California. The Province is 40 to 60 miles (60 to 100 km) wide
and stretches approximately 450 miles (720 km) from north-northwest to south-southeast, inland from
and parallel to the Pacific Ocean Coast Ranges to the west and Sierra Nevada Mountains to the east. The

Great Valley has been filled with hundreds to thousands of feet of eroded sediments, ranging in age from
Pleistocene to Holocene.
Based on our review of readily available published geologic literature/maps (CGS “Preliminary Geologic
Map of the Sacramento 30’ X 60’ Quadrangle, California”, 2011; scale 1:100,000) the site is mapped to
be underlain by Quaternary-aged Fan Deposits (Map Symbol: Qf). The total thickness of the formation
was not determined and is beyond the scope of this study. The native earth materials discovered in the
explorations are considered to be consistent with the mapped earth materials.
EARTH MATERIAL CONDITIONS
As shown on the Exploratory Logs (Appendix B), the subsurface earth material conditions were generally
consistent throughout the site. The uppermost soils encountered to a depth of approximately 1½ feet
below existing ground surface (begs) consisted of medium stiff, moist, dark brown, Sandy SILT, with
occasional Gravel (Unified Soil Classification: ML). Underlying the silt was discovered stiff to very stiff,
moist, light brown and dark brown, Sandy Silty CLAY (CL) to varying depths between 2½ to 3 feet begs.
The earth materials encountered below the upper soil to a depth of approximately 13 feet begs consisted
of very stiff and hard, moist, light brown with orange mottles and red-brown, Sandy SILT (ML). The earth
materials encountered below this layer consisted of dense, moist, dark brown to brown, SAND (SP) to a
depth of approximately 19 feet begs. Underlying the sand layer was found hard, moist, light brown,
Sandy SILT (ML) to the maximum explored depth of approximately 21½ feet begs.
Since the earth material profile is generalized, the reader is advised to consult the Explorations Logs
contained in Appendix B, if the earth material conditions at a specific depth and location are desired.
The logs contain a more detailed earth material description regarding color, earth material type, and
Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) symbol.
Earth material conditions cannot be fully determined by surface and subsurface explorations and earth
material sampling. Hence, unexpected earth material conditions might be encountered during
construction. If earth material conditions are encountered during construction which vary from earth
materials encountered during the investigation, then appropriate recommendations will be needed

during construction. Therefore, we suggest a contingency fund for additional expenditures that might
have to be made due to unforeseen conditions.
PERCOLATION TESTING
One percolation test boring was drilled with a 4-inch outer-diameter continuous flight helical solid stem
auger (SSA) powered by a truck mounted drill rig to the approximate depth indicated in the table below
within the proposed detention pond. The approximate depth of the percolation boring was selected per
the referenced grading plans. Please refer the attached “Exploration Location Map – Figure 2” for
approximate location of the percolation test.
The outer wall of the boring was scored to reduce the effects of smearing. Approximately six (6)-inches
of clean gravel was added to the bottom of the test hole. In the test boring a 2-inch inner diameter (ID)
PVC slotted pipe was installed into the hole on top of the gravel. Clean gravel was placed in the annular
space between the boring wall and pipe.
The boring was filled with water to the presoak level to let the soils presoak before performing the test.
Following the presoak time water was adjusted in each hole to at least 12 inches above the bottom of
the boring. The drop in water level was measured at specific time intervals until a steady rate of drop in
water level was obtained when at least three consecutive readings were within 10 percent from each
other. Pre-adjusted percolation rate was determined by dividing the drop in water level over the time
required for the drop in water level. The infiltration rate was determined using the percolation rate
divided by a Conversion Factor. The test results are shown on Table 1, below.

The infiltration rate (per the test method referenced above) of the soils shown on the above table could
be used by the General Civil Engineer as preliminary infiltration rates of the soils at the location and
depth indicated. A safety factor was not applied to these values. Once the basins have been constructed,

we suggest the infiltration rates be confirmed by double ring infiltrometer tests in the soil exposed in
the bottoms of the basins.
GROUNDWATER CONDITIONS
Observations of groundwater conditions were made during and just after drilling the exploratory
borings. Free groundwater was not encountered in any of the subsurface explorations.
CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
SITE SUITABILITY AND GEOTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
From a geotechnical standpoint, the site is considered suitable for the proposed construction provided
the conclusions and recommendations presented in this report are incorporated into the design and
construction of the project. Geotechnical considerations that were evaluated by our office include
disturbed soils due to historic agriculture usage and loose topsoil, which are discussed in the following
sections of this report.
BEARING CAPABILITY
Field and laboratory tests show that the affirmed undisturbed, native earth materials encountered at
the exploration locations are considered competent for support of the proposed construction. The
upper loose / soft soils and any disturbed soils (including undocumented fill, materials
disturbed/backfilled of the soils loosened due to agriculture, clearing trees, etc.) that are present at the
time of construction are not considered stable and should not be utilized to directly support new
structural elements. Mitigation measures for unsuitable soil conditions are discussed in the
Recommendations section of this report. Mitigation measures considered include removal and replacing
the disturbed and/or loose soils with engineered fill; or, foundation elements designed to extend
through the unsuitable soils.
Engineered fill, composed of approved materials placed and compacted according to the following
recommendations, and undisturbed native soils are considered competent for support of low to
moderate loading increases.

COMPRESSIBLE AND EXPANSIVE SOILS
Compressible materials consisting of surficial disturbed material, loose soils, undocumented fills, debris,
rubble, rubbish, etc., are considered unsuitable materials for support of the proposed structures. Such
materials can differentially settle. We consider that any undocumented fill encountered and disturbed
and / or soft/loose soil materials in the construction areas should be removed and replaced with
engineered fill, or special foundation mitigation measures designed. Overexcavated earth materials
deemed suitable for re-use as engineered fill could be stockpiled. If the unsuitable materials are not
removed, then special foundation systems should be designed to account for the potential settlements.
In areas where unsuitable or loose, wet soils are encountered, remedial grading should be undertaken
to remove the loose soils and ensure the removal of the entire disturbed soils.
Engineered fill, composed of approved granular materials placed and compacted according to those
discussed in the recommendations section, below, and undisturbed native soils are considered
competent for support of low to moderate loading increases anticipated for this project.
Based on visual observation and on laboratory test results performed on a representative soil sample of
the underlying, relatively thin layer of clay soil (Plasticity Index (PI) of 16, percent fines of 59) we consider
the expansion potential of the subsurface soils to be low.
Mitigation measures for potentially compressible soils would be to assure that native, undisturbed,
granular earth materials, recompacted soil, and/or engineered fill comprised of non- to low-expansive
soil is beneath the rough pad soil grade. Mitigation measures are presented in the Recommendations
section below for potentially compressible soils.
GROUNDWATER AND SEASONAL MOISTURE
As previously mentioned, free groundwater was not encountered during our subsurface investigation.
However, groundwater levels could be seasonal – varying between the winter and summer months. It is
our opinion that perched groundwater could have an impact on the proposed design or construction
depending on the foundation system selected by designers and depths of underground structures. If
wet-season construction is undertaken, then groundwater seepage into excavations is expected to be
generally controllable by pumping/diversion; likewise, inflow from surface (dependent on quantity and

duration of storm intensity/rainfall) is expected to be similarly controllable as temporarily necessary. If
the uppermost soils should become saturated, then this condition would likely impede or delay
grading operations.
Groundwater levels can fluctuate on a seasonal basis due to changes in precipitation, irrigation,
pumping, etc. We consider groundwater levels might change based on site topography and the time our
investigation was performed. Excavations below perched groundwater (if encountered) might be
impacted by seepage; therefore, we recommend grading and utility excavations be performed during
dry season when groundwater levels are lowest.
SEISMIC HAZARDS
Seismic ground shaking of the earth materials underlying the site can cause ground failures, including
fault rupture, liquefaction and densification, lateral spreading, landsliding, and tsunamis / seiches. The
following sections discuss our conclusions / opinions regarding these conditions based on our findings
and literature review.
Fault Rupture
Fault rupture hazards are important near active faults and tend to reoccur along the surface
traces of previous fault movements. The site is not located within an Alquist-Priolo Special
Studies Zone. We consider the potential for fault rupture, damage from fault displacement, or
fault movement directly below the site to be very low. However, the site is located within an area
where shaking from earthquake generated ground motion waves should be considered likely.
Seismic Ground Shaking
The mapped and design spectral response accelerations (refer to Appendix E) presents seismic
design criteria for the subject project site obtained from the SEAOC/OSHPD Seismic Design Maps
(https://seismicmaps.org) that are based on data provided by ASCE 7-16 and are for use with the
2019 California Building Code (CBC). The values for spectral response accelerations with a Risk
Category of II are summarized on the following table.

respectively) and corresponding Risk Category. Please refer to ASCE/SEI 7-16 Section 11.4.8 for base shear (V) calculations.
Please refer to Appendix E for the U.S. Seismic Design Maps.
Liquefaction and Seismic Settlement Evaluation
Liquefaction occurs when saturated fine-grained sands and/or silts lose their physical strength
temporarily during earthquake induced shaking and behave as a liquid. This is due to loss of
point-to-point grain contact and transfer of normal stress to the pore water. Liquefaction
potential varies with water level, soil type, material gradation, relative density, and probable
intensity and duration of ground shaking. Dynamic settlement of the soils that experience
liquefaction may occur after earthquake shaking has ceased.
The California Geological Survey (CGS) has designated certain areas within California as potential
liquefaction hazard zones. These are areas considered at risk of liquefaction-related ground
failure during a seismic event based upon mapped surficial deposits and the depth to the areal
groundwater table. The project site is not currently mapped for potential liquefaction hazard by
the CGS (refer to CGS website: https://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/earthquakes).
Subsurface exploration information indicates the site is predominately underlain by generally
dense sand soils and very stiff to hard sandy silt soils to the maximum depth explored of

Page 12
approximately 21½ feet begs. Based on the information discussed above, it is our opinion that
the potential for liquefaction at the site is very low if a seismic event should occur that might
impact the site.
Ground Lurching
Ground lurching is a result of the rolling motion imparted to the ground surface due to seismic
waves released by an earthquake that can cause cracks in weaker soils. The potential for cracking
at this site is considered low due to the generally dense relative densities and hard soil
consistencies.
Earthquake Induced Landsliding
Based on information available on the California Geological Survey (CGS) website the subject site
is not currently within a State of California Seismic Hazard Zone for seismically induced
landsliding. In addition, there are no steep slopes on or adjacent to the subject site. Therefore,
seismically induced and/or other landslides are not considered a significant hazard at the site.
Tsunamis and Seiche Evaluation
The site is not located near large bodies of water and the site is located at elevation of
approximately 35 feet above MSL. Based on the geometry of the site, the potential for tsunami
damage or damage caused by oscillatory waves (Seiche) is considered unlikely at the site.
ON-SITE EARTH MATERIALS SUITABILITY
On-site soils like those encountered in the test borings are generally considered suitable for re-use as
engineered fill provided the materials are processed to remove excessive moisture, rubble, rubbish,
oversize materials, significant organic matter, or any other substance deemed unsuitable (as determined
by an ACG field representative).
EXCAVATION CONDITIONS
It is anticipated that the soil materials at the site can be readily moved by conventional earth moving
equipment to at least the maximum depth explored of approximately 21½ feet begs.

POTENTIAL SLOPE STABILITY
No landslides, slumps, or other indications of slope instabilities were observed in the flat-lying site area
during our field investigation. We consider the potential for slope instability to be negligible.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations for earthwork and the design and construction of the proposed structure(s) and
associated improvements follow. All recommendations could require modifications based on conditions
encountered during earthworks and general construction. In addition, changes in the locations of the
proposed structures and pavements could also necessitate modifications to the recommendations
provided herein.
EARTHWORK
Earthwork specifications which may be used as a guide in the preparation of contract documents for site
preparation / grading are included in Appendix D. However, recommendations in the text of this report
supersede those presented in Appendix D. The conclusions and recommendations contained in this
report should be incorporated into the guide specifications.
Site Clearing and Stripping
Each building pad is considered to extend laterally away from (outside of) all perimeter
foundation/building edges at least five (5) feet in plan view, or to edges of any adjacent features
restricting this width. The improvement areas should be stripped to sufficient depth to remove
all organic laden topsoil. The actual stripping depth should be determined by our representative
at the time of construction. The cleared and stripped materials should be removed from the site
or stockpiled for possible use as landscape materials.
We recommend the construction areas be cleared of all obstructions or unsuitable materials,
including all loose, wet, or disturbed soil, undocumented fill, rubble, rubbish, vegetation,
structural elements (includes slabs and pavements) to be razed, and any buried utility lines to
be removed. Any foundations, pavements, cisterns, septic tanks, leach fields, water wells,

etcetera, that might be encountered and are to be abandoned should be removed. In addition,
in areas where trees have been or will be cleared, remedial grading includes removing the entire
tree root systems and the loosened soils resulting from the removal. The excavated soils could
be evaluated by ACG for reuse as engineered fill. The resulting subgrades of excavation(s) should
be prepared and filled to planned project subgrade level with engineered fill as discussed in the
following sections.
Excavations resulting from the removal of unsuitable materials and/or loose soils should be
cleared to expose firm, stable material. The surface of the resulting excavations should be
scarified to a depth of 8 inches and backfilled with approved earth materials compacted to the
requirements given below under subgrade preparation. Utilities that extend into the
construction area and are scheduled to be abandoned should be properly capped or plugged with
grout at the perimeter of the construction zone or moved as directed in the plans. It may be
feasible to abandon on-site utilities in-place by filling them with grout, provided they will not
interfere with future utilities or affect building foundations. The utility lines should be addressed
on a case-by-case basis.
Subgrade Preparation
Once the construction areas have been cleared, any unsuitable soils over-excavated, and any
other excavations made, then subgrades that will receive engineered fill, that are to be left at
existing grade, or that represent final subgrades in soil achieved by excavation should be scarified
to at least 8 inches. Suitability of soils exposed in the bottom of all subgrades should be verified
by an ACG special inspector during site grading. Upon favorable review, exposed soil subgrades
should be scarified and recompacted (in-place) an additional 8 inches and/or prior to placing
engineered fill materials to planned rough pad grade. The scarified soils should be uniformly
moisture conditioned as determined by ACG’s field representative based upon the compaction
characteristics of the earth material (typically 1 to 4 percent over optimum) and compacted to at
least 90 percent relative compaction per ASTM D 1557. The geotechnical engineer’s special

construction equipment (e.g., loaded water truck) in order to verify subgrade earth material
stability. Inability to achieve the recommended moisture content, compaction, and/or
instability of the subgrade materials is/are considered unsuitable conditions and would be
used as criteria for remediation, such as the removal of loose, wet, or soft soils; or, for the need
of special stabilizing measures.
If unsuitable materials are encountered at subgrade such that they are expansive, unstable
and/or proper compaction cannot be obtained, then mitigation measures would be
recommended. In addition, construction equipment on saturated soils could destabilize the earth
materials, sometimes to several feet of depth, which might necessitate further over excavation
and/or special stabilization.
An ACG special inspector should observe and approve the subgrade soils exposed in all
excavations to confirm suitable conditions have been reached and should observe and approve
the scarification, moisture conditioning and recompaction of the exposed soil subgrades.
Material for Fill
All fill materials should be inorganic, low plasticity soils free of vegetation, debris, and fragments
larger than three inches in size. Pea gravel or other similar non-cementitious, poorly graded
materials should not be used as fill or backfill without the prior approval of the geotechnical
engineer. Imported earth materials and or earth materials from onsite borrow areas may be used
as engineered fill material for general site grading, foundation backfill, foundation areas, trench
backfill, slab areas, and pavement areas, provided they meet the following soil classification
criteria. All fill materials from any source (on-site or off-site) to be used for engineered fill should
be pre-approved by this firm and should be observed by our representative and samples obtained
for laboratory classification testing at least four days prior to any materials being used for
engineered fill.

Fill Placement and Compaction
Engineered fill should be placed and compacted in horizontal lifts, using equipment and
procedures that will produce recommended moisture contents and densities throughout the lift.
Materials for engineered fill should be spread and compacted in lifts not exceeding 8 inches in
uncompacted thickness. Engineered fill placed at the site and subgrades requiring recompaction
should be uniformly compacted to at least 90 percent relative compaction in building areas, and
to at least 95 percent relative compaction in the upper 12-inches of pavement and flatwork areas,
as determined by ASTM Test Designation D 1557, or to the method as might be determined by
an ACG special inspector. The moisture content of engineered fill materials should be determined
by ACG’s field representative based upon the compaction characteristics of the earth material
(typically 1 to 4 percent over optimum). ACG should continuously observe and test the grading
and earthwork operations. Such observations and tests are essential to identify field conditions
that differ from those predicted by this investigation, to adjust these recommendations to actual
field conditions encountered, and to verify that the grading is in overall accordance with the
recommendations presented in this report and the 2019 CBC.
If construction proceeds during or shortly after the wet winter months, it may require time to dry
the on-site soils since their moisture content will probably be appreciably above the optimum.
In addition, if subgrade soils are wet at the time of construction, they could be rutted, loosened,
or otherwise disturbed to several feet of depth by the construction equipment and require
additional over-excavation and/or stabilization.

Page 17
Construction occurring in later summer or early fall (after on-site earth materials becoming dry)
may require substantial amounts of water to be added during earthwork operations to enable
the appropriate moisture content and compaction to be achieved.
Upon completion of filling and grading, care should be taken to maintain the subgrade moisture
content prior to construction of foundations, exterior flatwork/slabs, and pavements.
Construction traffic over the completed subgrade should be avoided to prevent disturbance of
subgrade soils. The site should also be graded to prevent ponding of surface water on the
prepared subgrades or in excavations. If the subgrade consisting of engineered fill should
become desiccated, saturated, or disturbed, the affected material should be removed, or these
materials should be scarified, moisture conditioned, and recompacted prior to construction.
The geotechnical engineer should be retained during the earthwork construction phase of the
project to continuously observe earthwork and to perform necessary tests and observations
during subgrade preparation, backfilling of excavations to the completed subgrade, placement
and compaction of engineered fills, proof-rolling, backfilling of utility trenches, etc.
Utility Trench Backfill
Generally, utility trenches should be backfilled with mechanically compacted fill placed in lifts not
exceeding 6 inches in uncompacted thickness. Water content of the fill material should be
adjusted (typically 1 to 4 percent over optimum) during the trench backfilling operations to
obtain compaction. If on-site soil or import fill material is used, then the material should be
compacted to at least 90 percent relative compaction. Imported sand could also be used for
bedding and shading backfill in trenches provided the sand is compacted to at least 95 percent
relative compaction. Public and private utility companies’ standard plans and specifications
should be adhered to when backfilling their utility trenches. Excavations parallel with the
building’s footings should be in compliance with the 2019 CBC Section 1809.14 setback
requirements.
Utility trenches should be plugged with lean concrete wherever the utility line passes beneath
the perimeters of the structures. The plug should be at least one foot on either side of the

perimeter of the building perimeter foundation and extend from the bottom of the building
foundation to the bottom of the trench.
Finish Grading and Site Drainage
We consider on-site soils to be moderately susceptible to erosion where drainage concentrations
occur. Concentrated flowing water should be either dissipated or channeled to appropriate
discharge facilities. Appropriate erosion control measures should be provided, where applicable,
by the general civil engineer on his grading and/or winterization plan.
Positive surface gradients should be provided adjacent to the buildings and pavement areas
(includes flatwork) to direct surface water away from the buildings and pavements for at least
ten feet and toward suitable discharge facilities. Ponding of surface water should not be allowed
adjacent to the buildings or pavements or on top of pavement. Positive drainage should be
provided during construction and maintained throughout the life of the project. Infiltration of
water into utility trenches or foundation excavations should be prevented during construction.
Backfill against foundations, exterior walls, and in utility and sprinkler line trenches should be
well compacted as previously recommended and free of all construction debris to reduce the
possibility of moisture infiltration. We recommend a horizontal setback distance of at least 10
feet from the perimeter of any building and the high-water elevation of the nearest storm-water
retention.
Downspouts, roof drains or scuppers should discharge into splash blocks or extensions when the
ground surface beneath such features is not protected by exterior slabs or paving. Sprinkler
systems should not be installed within 5 feet of foundation walls. Landscaped irrigation adjacent
to the foundation system should be minimized or eliminated.
All grades must provide effective drainage away from the buildings during and after construction.
Water permitted to pond next to a building can result in greater soil movements than those
discussed in this report. These greater movements can result in unacceptable differential floor
slab movements, cracked slabs and walls, vapor transmission issues in interior slabs, and roof

leaks. Estimated movements described in this report are based on effective drainage for the life
of the structures and cannot be relied upon if effective drainage is not maintained.
Per 2019 CBC Section 1804.4, the soil ground surface should be sloped at least 5 percent (2
percent for pavement) down and away from the buildings for at least of 10 feet beyond the
perimeter of the buildings or pavement. After building construction and landscaping, we
recommend the Civil Engineer and/or surveyor verify final grades to document that effective
drainage has been achieved. Grades around the structure should also be periodically inspected
and adjusted as necessary, as part of the structure’s maintenance program.
Cut and Fill Slopes
Cut/fill slopes are not anticipated. If slopes should be needed, then permanent excavation and
embankment slopes up to 10 feet of height in soil should be graded at an inclination of 2
horizontal to 1 vertical (2H: 1V) or flatter. The crowns of all slopes should be constructed so that
surface run-off water is not allowed to flow over the faces of the slopes. All cut slopes should be
observed during grading by the Geotechnical Engineer and/or Engineering Geologist to
determine if any adverse defects are present. If defects are observed, then additional study
and/or recommendations would be made at that time.
For temporary excavations, the individual contractor(s) is/are responsible for designing and
constructing stable, temporary excavations as required to maintain stability of both the
excavation sides and bottom. Excavations should be sloped or shored in the interest of safety
following local and federal regulations, including current OSHA excavation and trench safety
standards.
Earthwork Construction Considerations
At the time of our study, moisture contents of the surface and near-surface native soils were low.
Based on these moisture contents, some moisture conditioning will likely be needed for the
project to make the soil compactible and suitable for use as engineered fill. The soils may need
to be dried by aeration during wet weather conditions, or a chemical treatment, such as cement,

lime, or kiln dust, may be needed to stabilize the soil. The soils may need more moisture and
water during the dry season to make the soil compactible and suitable. Subgrade conditions may
require a rock protective mat covering of exposed subgrades to limit disturbance of the site soils
as well as provide a stable base for construction equipment.
Although the exposed subgrades are anticipated to be relatively stable upon initial exposure, on
site soils may pump and unstable subgrade conditions could develop during general construction
operations, particularly if the soils are wet and/or subjected to repetitive construction traffic. The
use of light construction equipment would aid in reducing subgrade disturbance. The use of
remotely operated equipment, such as a backhoe, would be beneficial to perform cuts and
reduce subgrade disturbance. If unstable subgrade conditions develop, then stabilization
measures will need to be employed. Upon completion of filling and grading, care should be taken
to maintain the subgrade moisture content just prior to construction of the floor slabs and
pavements. Construction traffic over the completed subgrades should be avoided to the extent
practical. The site should also be graded to prevent ponding of surface water on the prepared
subgrades or in excavations. If the subgrade should become desiccated, saturated, or disturbed,
the affected material should be removed, or these materials should be scarified, moisture
conditioned, and recompacted prior to floor slab and pavement construction.
We anticipate that site grading for concrete foundations, slab construction, pavements and
shallow utility trenches could be performed with conventional earthmoving equipment.
We emphasize the contractor is responsible for designing and constructing stable, temporary
excavations (including utility trenches) as required to maintain stability of both the excavation
sides and bottom and should be in accordance with OSHA excavation and trench safety
standards.
We recommend that the earthwork portion of this project be completed during extended periods
of dry weather if possible. If earthwork is completed during the wet season (typically November
through May) it may be necessary to take extra precautionary measures to protect subgrade
soils. Wet season earthwork may require additional mitigation measures beyond that which

would be expected during the drier summer and fall months. This could include diversion of
surface runoff around exposed soils and draining of ponded water on the site. Once subgrades
are established, it may be necessary to protect the exposed subgrade soils from construction
traffic.
Geotechnical Engineering Earthwork Construction Observation
As previously discussed, variations in subsurface conditions are possible and may be encountered
during construction. In order to permit correlation between the preliminary subsurface data
obtained during this investigation and the actual subsurface conditions encountered during
construction, as well as affirm substantial conformance with the plans and specifications, a
representative of this firm should be present during all phases of the site earthwork to make tests
and observations of the site preparation, selection of satisfactory fill materials, proof rolling,
placement and compaction of controlled compacted fills, backfilling of excavations to the
completed subgrade, etc. Additionally, if lime or cement treatment is needed to stabilize or dry
the soil, then our representative should perform observations during mixing, remixing and
compaction.
Any site earthwork performed without the presence of our representative will be entirely at the
grading contractor's and/or owner's risk and no responsibility for such operations will be
accepted by our firm. Sufficient notification (at least two working days) is necessary so that our
special inspections and testing will coincide with the construction schedule.
We emphasize the importance of ACG’s presence during the observation and testing of the
grading operations. ACG’s observation of the subsurface soil conditions, especially under the
loads imposed by construction equipment, is considered an extension of our investigation,
particularly within those areas away from the subsurface explorations.
Guide Specifications
Earthwork guide specifications which may be used as a guide in the preparation of contract
documents for site grading are included in Appendix D. The conclusions and recommendations
contained in this report should be incorporated into the guide specifications.

CRITERIA FOR FOUNDATION DESIGN
Based on the field and laboratory information for this study, we recommend the proposed half plexus
and the residential home be supported upon isolated and/or continuous spread footings penetrate
below the lowest adjacent building pad soil grade into the bearing earth materials at least 12-inches for
one-story structures and 18-inches for 2- to 3-story structures. Foundation dimensions and
reinforcement should be based on allowable dead plus live soil bearing values of 1,700 pounds per
square foot (psf) for continuous footings of at least 15 inches in width and isolated footings at least 24
inches wide (both directions). The foundations should be supported on engineered fill and/or
undisturbed, native soil. The allowable foundation bearing pressures apply to dead loads plus design
live load conditions. The design bearing pressure may be increased by one-third when considering total
loads that include short duration wind or seismic conditions. The weight of the foundation concrete
below grade may be neglected in dead load computations.
Total settlement is estimated at about 1-inch for static compression and is expected to occur the
structure is built. We recommend that all footings be reinforced as designed by the structural engineer
to provide structural continuity, to permit strong spanning of local irregularities and to be rigid enough
to accommodate potential differential movements. Foundations should be proportioned to reduce
differential foundation movement estimated at ½-inch over 20 linear feet. Proportioning based on equal
total settlement is recommended; however, proportioning to relative constant dead-load pressure
would reduce differential settlement between adjacent foundations.
Lateral Resistance
Foundations placed in approved soil bearing materials (undisturbed native soil and/or
engineered fill) could be designed using a coefficient of friction of 0.30 for native and/or
engineered fill soils. A design passive resistance value of 275 pounds per square foot per foot
(psf/ft) of depth (with a maximum value of 2,750 pounds per square foot) is recommended for
native, undisturbed soil and/or engineered fill comprised of pre-approved soil. If both friction
and passive pressures are combined, then the smaller value should be halved. For fine grained
soils, in no case should the lateral sliding resistance exceed one-half the dead load.

The sides of the excavations for the foundations should be nearly vertical and the concrete should
be placed neat against these vertical faces for the passive earth pressure values to be valid. If the
loaded side is sloped or benched in the soil, and then backfilled with engineered fill, then the
nominal passive pressure should be reduced to the soil frictional or adhesive resistance.
General Foundation Considerations
ACG’s geotechnical engineer or his representative should observe earth material conditions
exposed in foundation excavations to confirm the adequacy for structural foundation bearing,
confirm the appropriateness of these recommendations, and to allow for an opportunity to
provide additional recommendations if deemed necessary. If the earth material conditions
encountered differ significantly from those presented in this report, then supplemental
recommendations will be required.
An important factor in soils supporting structural improvements is a change in moisture content.
The recommendations herein are predicated on the soil moisture beneath and within five feet of
the building perimeters, slabs and pavements being maintained in a uniform condition during
and after construction. Please be advised that over watering or under watering, types of plants
(trees should be at least the distance away from the improvement equal to their maximum
height), altering design site drainage, etc., might be detrimental to the foundation, slabs, and/or
pavements. We suggest that automatic timing devices be utilized on irrigation systems; however,
provision should be made to interrupt the normal watering cycle during and following periods of
rainfall. Additional foundation movements could occur if water, from any source, saturates the
foundation soils; therefore, proper drainage should be provided during in the final design, during
construction, and maintained for the life of the development.
Static and seismic settlement could affect various aspects of the planned development, including
utilities, building entrances, sidewalks, footings, and grade beams. Design of these elements
should incorporate features to mitigate the effects of the predicted settlements. Because of the
anticipated settlements during an earthquake, it may be necessary to replace esthetic features,
sheetrock, glazing, exterior flatwork, etc., after a major earthquake.

Page 24
The foundation excavations should be clean (i.e., free of all loose slough) and maintained in a
moist condition between 1 to 4 percent over optimum just prior to placing steel and concrete.
The concrete for the foundation should not be placed against a dry excavation surface.
The base of all foundation excavations should be free of water, loose soil, and gravel prior to
placing concrete. Concrete should be placed soon after excavating and placement of engineered
fill (and lime treatment, if needed) to reduce bearing soil disturbance. Should the soils at bearing
level become excessively dry, disturbed, or saturated, the affected soil should be removed prior
to placing concrete. In addition, as previously described, unsuitable soils should be completely
removed from any proposed construction areas prior to construction. Concrete should not be
chuted against the excavation sidewalls. Concrete should be pumped or placed by means of a
tremie or elephant's trunk to avoid aggregate segregation and earth contamination. Rebar
reinforcement should be properly supported with proper clearances maintained during concrete
placement. The concrete should be properly vibrated to mitigate formation of voids and to promote
bonding of the concrete to steel reinforcing. These recommendations are predicated upon ACG’s
representative observing the bearing materials as well as the manner of concrete placement.
Foundation Setback
The bottoms of utility trenches placed along the perimeter of the foundation should be above an
imaginary plane that projects at a 2H:1V angle projected down from a point on the side of the
footing that is 9-inches above the lowest outermost edge of the bottom of the foundation per
the 2019 CBC Section 1809.14. Where trenches pass through the plane, the trench should be
installed perpendicular to the face of the foundation for at least the distance of the depth of the
foundation. Alternatively, the foundation could be deepened to attain the recommended
setback. Foundation details under the influence of this recommendation should be forwarded
along with the structural load information to the geotechnical engineer for review.
INTERIOR FLOOR SLAB-ON-GROUND SUPPORT
On most project sites, the site mass grading is generally accomplished early in the construction phase.
However, as construction proceeds, the subgrade soils may be disturbed due to utility excavations,

construction traffic, desiccation, rainfall, etc. As a result, the floor slab subgrade soils may not be suitable
for placement of base rock and concrete and corrective action will be required.
We recommend the subgrade soil underlying the floor slab be graded per the Earthwork section, above,
and then thoroughly proof rolled with a loaded tandem axle dump truck or water truck prior to final
grading and placement of base rock. Particular attention should be paid to high traffic areas that were
rutted and disturbed earlier and to areas where backfilled trenches are located. Areas where unsuitable
conditions are located should be repaired by removing and replacing the affected material as engineered
fill.
A building pad comprised of ACG approved subgrade soil (graded per the criteria contained within the
above “Earthwork” section) is considered suitable for support of the slabs-on-ground of the building
without further treatment. The subgrade soils should be maintained at 1 to 4 percent above the
compaction moisture content in the upper 12 inches. In all cases the floor slab should not be placed on
a dry subgrade.
Lightly loaded building floor slab design, thickness and reinforcement should be as designed by the
structural designer for the anticipated loadings based on a modulus of subgrade soil reaction (k)
estimated at 75 pounds per square inch per inch (psi/in). We recommend that slabs-on-grade should
be at least 4-inches thick for light duty use. The slabs should be supported on at least 5-inches thick
crushed rock or at least 5 inches of Class II aggregate base (compacted to 95% relative compaction)
that is underlain by approved subgrade soils prepared per the recommendations of this report. The
exterior ground surface should be at least 6 inches below the top of the floor slab. We emphasize that
all surfaces should slope to drain away from all sides of the building. Slabs subjected to heavier loads
may require thicker slab sections and/or increased reinforcement.
Slabs-on-grade subject to low frequency, light vehicle traffic should be at least five inches thick, or as per
the project structural engineer, and have at least a six-inch thick layer of Class 2 aggregate base
(compacted to at least 95 percent relative compaction) placed beneath the slabs. If elastic design is
utilized for designing slabs-on-grade founded on at least a six-inch thick layer of Class 2 aggregate base
compacted to at least 95 percent relative compaction, then the design k value may be increased to 125

pci. The modulus was provided based on the slab being supported on 6 inches or more of compacted
aggregate base and estimates obtained from NAVFAC 7.1 design charts. This value is for a small, loaded
area (1 sq. foot or less) such as for small truck wheel loads or point loads and should be adjusted for
larger loaded areas. Slabs subjected to heavier loads may require thicker slab sections and/or increased
reinforcement. The slabs should be separated from the foundations supporting the structures to allow
for differential movements between the two elements. We suggest the structural designer consider slab
reinforcement consist of at least #3 reinforcing bars placed on maximum 24-inch centers at mid-slab
height.
Floor Slab Moisture Penetration Resistance
We are not experts regarding measures for mitigating (or preventing) moisture intrusion into
building’s first floor slab(s)-on-grade. If such should be desired, then an expert regarding
moisture intrusion should be consulted.
We suggest the following measures for mitigating (not preventing) moisture intrusion into
moisture sensitive interior floor slab(s). The floor slabs should be underlain by a 4-inch-thick layer
of crushed washed rock which is intended to serve as a capillary mitigating moisture break and
to provide uniform slab support. Gradation of this material should be such that 100 percent will
pass a 1-inch sieve and 0 to 5 percent passes the No. 4 sieve. When conditions warrant the use
of a vapor retarder, the slab designer should refer to ACI 302 and/or ACI 360 for procedures and
cautions regarding the use and placement of a vapor retarder. At a minimum, we recommend in
areas where it is desired to reduce floor dampness where moisture-sensitive coverings are
anticipated, construction should have a suitable waterproof vapor retarder (at least 15 mils thick
polyethylene vapor retarder sheeting, Raven Industries “VaporBlock 15, Stego Industries 15 mil
“StegoWrap” or W.R. Meadows Sealtight 15 mil “Perminator”) incorporated into the floor slab
design. The water vapor retarder should be decay resistant material complying with ASTM E96
not exceeding 0.04 perms, ASTM E154 and ASTM E1745 Class A. The vapor barrier should be
placed between the concrete slab and the compacted granular aggregate subbase material. The
water vapor retarder (vapor barrier) should be installed in accordance with ASTM Specification E
1643-94 or the manufacturer’s recommendations, whichever is more stringent. If maximum two

Page 27
inches of clean sand should be placed above the vapor retarder (not recommended), then we
recommend a moisture barrier be placed against the outer face of the perimeter foundation.
Please note that the sand can be a conduit for water beneath the slab. In addition, the sand can
form boils/pockets in the slab concrete. If proposed floor areas or coverings are considered
especially sensitive to moisture emissions, additional recommendations from a specialty
consultant should be obtained. If desired, further resistance to moisture vapor intrusion could
be achieved with proper curing of the concrete, adding a sealant to the mix (e.g., Moxie), having
a mix design with low slump (e.g., 2 to 4 inches), low water/cement ratio (we suggest not greater
than 0.48), and high strength (we suggest at least 3000 psi).
The structural engineer/Architect and slab-on-grade floor installation contractor should refer to
ACI 302 and ACI 360 for procedures and cautions regarding the use and placement of a vapor
barrier. In areas of exposed concrete, control joints should be saw-cut into the slab after concrete
placement in accordance with ACI Design Manual, Section 302.1R-37 8.3.12 (tooled control joints
are not recommended). To control the width of cracking, continuous slab reinforcement should
be considered in exposed concrete slabs.
Positive separations and/or isolation joints should be provided between slabs and all
foundations, columns, or utility lines to allow independent movement. Interior trench backfill
placed beneath slabs should be compacted in accordance with recommendations outlined in the
Earthwork section of this report and Appendix D. Other design and construction considerations,
as outlined in the ACI Design Manual, Section 302.1R are recommended.
EXTERIOR FLATWORK
We recommend exterior concrete flatwork subject to only pedestrian traffic be at least 4 inches thick
and underlain by at least 5 inches of Class II aggregate base by approved subgrade soils prepared per the
“Earthwork” recommendations section of this report.
To reduce the potential for distress to exterior flatwork that might be caused by differential movement
of subgrade soils, we recommend that such flatwork be installed with crack-control joints at appropriate
spacing as designed by the project architect. Flatwork, which should be installed with crack control

according to the recommendations in the Earthwork section before placing concrete. Positive drainage

The R-value test result by exudation at 300 psi is 19 for Sandy Silt subgrade soil that was obtained from
R-1 location shown in Figure 2 - Explorations Map. Based on the R-value indicated and the Traffic indices
(T.I.’s) indicated below, pavement section alternatives for the on-site pavement were evaluated per the
CalTrans "Highway Design Manual" (HDM). A factor of safety per CalTrans HDM was not applied for on-
site pavements. The Traffic Index selected for the final pavement design should be based upon the
CalTrans "Highway Design Manual" - latest revision and/or edition - including consideration of the
vehicular traffic anticipated, number of repetitions, etc., - as determined by your general civil engineer
or per regulatory agency requirements. Estimated pavement sections for light (T.I. = 5; e.g., daily cars
and pickups, weekly light delivery trucks, occasional fire trucks up to 40 tons, etc.) to medium duty
vehicles (T.I. = 6 to 7; e.g., weekly garbage trucks, construction equipment, etc.) are summarized on the
following table:

pavement sections (vs. those listed above) could result if the resulting test(s) is/are different than that
used for this study.
The preliminary sections above should be reviewed and approved by the owner, the civil engineer, and
the governing authorities prior to construction. In addition, other recommendations for the stated traffic
indices are available, if needed. The total thickness of most sections would closely approximate those
given. Thinner sections than those recommended could result in increased maintenance and/or shorter
pavement life. If desired, please contact this office for further analysis.
Asphalt concrete paved areas should be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with, for
example, the recommendations of the Asphalt Institute, CalTrans Highway Design Manual, or other
widely recognized authority. Concrete paved areas should be designed and constructed in accordance
with the recommendations of the American Concrete Institute, CalTrans Highway Design Manual, or
other widely recognized authority, particularly regarding thickened edges, joints, and drainage.
Materials and compaction requirements within the structural sections should conform to the applicable
provisions of the CalTrans Standard Specifications (latest edition) including at least 95 percent relative
compaction of at least the uppermost twelve inches of subgrade earth materials. Asphalt concrete
pavement should conform to the specifications of Type A or B per section 39, and aggregate base should
conform to the specifications of Class II per Section 26 of the referenced specifications.
Concrete pavements could be reinforced with nominal rebar, such as at least #4 bars spaced no greater
than 24 inches, on center, both ways, placed at above mid-slab height, but with proper concrete cover,
as designed by the pavement engineer or structural engineer. If concrete pavements are to be
unreinforced, then we suggest the designer use expansion/contraction and/or construction joints
spaced no greater than 24 times the pavement thickness, both ways, in nearly square patterns, and
detailed in general accordance with ACI Guidelines. Doweling of concrete pavements at critical pathways
is also recommended.
We recommend that reinforced concrete pads be provided for truck pad areas in front of and beneath
trash receptacles as determined by the structural designer. The trash collection trucks should be parked
on the rigid concrete pavement when the trash receptacles are lifted. The concrete pads should be at

least 6 inches thick and properly reinforced. Thickened edges should be used along outside edges of
concrete pavements. Edge thickness should be at least 2 inches thicker than concrete pavement
thickness and taper to the actual concrete pavement thickness 36 inches inward from the edge. Integral
curbs may be used in lieu of thickened edges.
The above pavement section alternatives were estimated on the basis that a comparable soil type with
R-value indicated above would constitute the final subgrade of the pavement. We emphasize that ACG
should be retained to observe and test final subgrade soil(s) exposed to affirm that the soil is comparable
to that indicated above. Where differing earth materials are encountered, they should be tested to
affirm that they will also provide the same or better support for pavement sections like those
recommended above for preliminary design.
Adequate drainage systems should be provided to prevent both surface and subsurface saturation of the
subgrade soils. As a design option, a subdrain system beneath and along the edges of the pavements
might be considered. The purpose of the system would be to mitigate saturation and loss of
strength/stability of the subgrade soils. Subdrains should be especially considered beneath valley drains,
if utilized for the project. As an alternate to edge drains (especially around landscape planters), barrier
curbing that extends to at least four inches into the soil subgrade below the bottom of the aggregate
base layer could be considered to limit infiltration of water beneath the adjacent pavement. Drainage
inlets should be perforated (weep holes installed) at the level of the aggregate base layer. A layer of
geotextile fabric should be placed on the outside of the drain inlet over the weep holes to reduce the
potential for migration or piping of fines through the holes.
Base course or pavement materials should not be placed when the subgrade surface is wet. Surface
drainage should be provided away from the edge of paved areas to minimize lateral moisture
transmission into the subgrade.
Pavement Construction Considerations
On most project sites, the site grading is generally accomplished early in the construction phase.
However, as construction proceeds, the subgrades may become disturbed due to utility
excavations, construction traffic, rainfall, etc. As a result, the pavement subgrade may not be

suitable for placement of aggregate base and pavement. We recommend the area underlying
the pavement be rough graded and proof-rolled prior to placement of aggregate base material.
Particular attention should be paid to high traffic areas and utility trenches that were backfilled.
Areas where disturbance has occurred and materials are unsuitable, they should be removed and
replaced with compacted structural fill.
The aggregate base should be uniformly moisture-conditioned and compacted to at least 95
percent relative compaction (modified proctor) in accordance with this report. Base course or
pavement materials should not be placed when the surface is wet. Surface drainage should be
provided away from the edge of paved areas to minimize lateral moisture transmission into the
subgrade.
Minimizing subgrade saturation is an important factor in maintaining subgrade strength. Water
allowed to pond on or adjacent to pavements could saturate the subgrade and cause premature
pavement deterioration. The pavement should be sloped to provide rapid surface drainage, and
positive surface drainage should be maintained away from the edge of the paved areas. Design
alternatives which could reduce the risk of subgrade saturation and improve long-term pavement
performance include crowning the pavement subgrades to drain toward the edges, rather than
to the center of the pavement areas; and installing surface drains next to any areas where surface
water could pond. Properly designed and constructed subsurface drainage will reduce the time
subgrade soils are saturated and can also improve subgrade strength and performance. In areas
where there will be irrigation adjacent to pavements, we recommend the owner consider
installing perimeter drains for the pavements.
Preventative maintenance should be planned and provided for through an on-going pavement
management program to enhance future pavement performance. Preventative maintenance
activities are intended to slow the rate of pavement deterioration, and to preserve the pavement
investment.

APPENDIX B
FIELD EXPLORATION METHODS
LOGS OF SUBSURFACE EXPLORATIONS

FIELD EXPLORATION METHODS
Field exploration included a general geotechnical engineering reconnaissance within the study area, as well as
the excavation of subsurface explorations at approximate locations shown on the Explorations Map, Figure
2, Appendix A. Locations of explorations were determined in the field by estimating from the existing site
features shown on an aerial photo. The exploration locations should only be considered accurate to the degree
implied by the means and methods used to define them. The explorations were accomplished, and the soil
logging and sampling performed by, a Staff Geologist and/or Engineer under the direct supervision of a
California licensed Geotechnical Engineer. The explorations were conducted to determine the geometry and
geotechnical characteristics of subsurface geologic deposits at the site.
The exploratory borings were advanced with a 4-inch outer-diameter continuous flight helical solid stem augers
(SSA) powered by a truck mounted drill rig. Relatively undisturbed soil samples were recovered from the borings
at selected intervals by either a 1.4-inch SPT (standard penetration) or 2-inch inner-diameter samplers (Modified
California) advanced with an automatic hammer driving a 140 lb. hammer freely falling 30 inches (standard 350-
foot/lb. striking force). The number of blows of the hammer required to drive the samplers each 6-inch to 18-
inch interval of each drive is denoted as the penetration resistance or "blow count" and provides a field estimate
of soil consistency/relative density. Blow counts shown on the logs have not been corrected/converted.
Selected undisturbed samples were retained in moisture-proof containers for laboratory testing and reference.
Bulk soil samples were recovered directly from excavation cuttings and placed in sealed plastic sample bag(s).
Soils were logged in the field by the Staff Geologist or Engineer and were field classified based on inspection
of samples and auger cuttings per the Unified Soil Classification System (ASTM D2487) by color, gradation,
texture, type, etc. Groundwater observations were made in the explorations during and after drilling.
Exploration log prepared for the exploration provides soil descriptions and field estimated depths. The
exploration logs are included in this Appendix B which also contains the Explorations Log Legend. This log
includes visual classifications of the materials encountered during drilling as well as the field engineer’s
interpretation of the subsurface conditions. Final exploration logs included with this report represents the
geotechnical engineer's interpretation of the field logs.
Samples of the subsurface soil earth materials were obtained from the exploratory borings for use in laboratory
testing to further determine the soil’s engineering properties and geotechnical design parameters to be used
for future site improvements. The samples were tagged for identification, sealed to reduce moisture loss, and
taken to our laboratory for further examination, testing, and classification. Bulk soil samples were recovered
directly from excavation cuttings and placed in a plastic sample bag. Soil samples were then transported to
ACG’s soil mechanics laboratory for further testing. Field descriptions within the exploration logs have been
modified, where appropriate, to reflect laboratory test results. Upon completion of drilling the test borings
were backfilled from final test boring depth up to original ground surface with soil cuttings.

LABORATORY TESTING

LABORATORY TESTING
Samples retrieved during the field exploration were taken to the soil mechanics laboratory for further
observation by the project geotechnical engineer and were classified in accordance with the Unified Soil
Classification System (USCS) described in Appendix B. An applicable laboratory testing program was formulated
for classification testing and to determine engineering properties of the subsurface earth materials. The field
descriptions were confirmed or modified based on the test results.
Soil mechanics laboratory tests were performed on soil samples recovered from the explorations to further
determine the physical and engineering properties of the soils. These tests included R-value test (CTM 301),
gradation (ASTM D422), dry density (ASTM D 2937), Atterberg limits (ASTM D 4318) and natural moisture
content (ASTM D 2216). The results of these tests are shown on the Exploration Log at the depth that each
sample was recovered. The R-value test results are attached. The laboratory test results were used for the
geotechnical engineering analyses, and the development of engineering, earthwork, and construction
recommendations.

APPENDIX D
GUIDE SPECIFICATIONS FOR EARTHWORK

GUIDE SPECIFICATIONS FOR EARTHWORK
A. General Description
1. This item shall consist of all clearing and grubbing, removal of existing obstructions, preparation of
the land to be filled, filling the land, spreading, compaction and control of the fill, and all subsidiary
work necessary to complete the grading of the cut and fill areas to conform with the lines, grades and
slopes as shown on the accepted plans.
2. The Geotechnical Engineer is not responsible for determining line, grade elevations or slope
gradients. The property owner or his representative shall designate the party that will be responsible
for those items of work.
B. Geotechnical Report
1. The Geotechnical Report has been prepared for this project by Allerion Consulting Group (ACG),
Roseville, California, (916-742-5096). This report was for design purposes only and may not be
sufficient to prepare an accurate bid. A copy of the report is available for review at ACG's office.
2. Contents of these guide specifications shall be integrated with the Geotechnical Report of which they
are a part and shall not be used as a self-contained document. Where a conflict occurs between
these guide specifications and the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report, then
the conclusions and recommendations shall take precedence and these guide specifications adjusted
accordingly.
C. Site Preparation
1. Clearing Area(s) to be Filled: All trees, brush, logs, rubbish, and other debris shall be removed and
disposed of to leave the areas that have been disturbed with a neat appearance. Underground
structures shall be removed or may be crushed in place upon approval by the Geotechnical Engineer.
Excavations and depressions resulting from the removal of the above items shall be cleaned out to
firm undisturbed soil and backfilled with suitable materials in accordance with the specifications
contained herein. Stockpiles of clean soil may be reused as filled material provided the soil is free of
significant vegetation, debris, rubble, and rubbish and is approved by the Geotechnical Engineer.
2. Surfaces upon which fill is to be placed, as well as subgrades of structure pad(s) left at existing grade,
shall have all organic material removed; or, with permission of the Geotechnical Engineer, closes cut
and remove vegetation and thoroughly disc and blend the remaining nominal organics into the upper
soil. Discing must be thorough enough so that no concentrations of organics remain, which may
require re-discing or cross-discing several times.
3. Organic laden material removed per paragraph C.2. above, may be used as fill in landscaped areas
provided that the material shall not extend closer than ten (10) feet to any structure, shall not exceed
two (2) feet in thickness or be used where the material could, in the opinion of the Geotechnical
Engineer, create a slope stability problem, and shall be compacted to at least eighty-two (82) percent
relative compaction per ASTM Test Designation D 1557. Alternatively, the organic laden material may
be hauled off-site and suitably disposed of.

4. Upon completion of the organic removal, exposed surface shall be plowed or scarified to a depth of
at least six (6) inches, and until the surface is free from ruts, hummocks, or other uneven features
which would tend to prevent uniform compaction by the equipment to be used. Where vegetation
has been close cut and removed and remaining organics blended with the upper soil, further
scarifying may not be necessary. Where fills are to be placed on hill slopes, scarifying shall be to
depths adequate to provide bond between fill and fill foundation. Where considered necessary by
the Geotechnical Engineer, (typically where the slope ratio of the original ground is steeper than five
(5) horizontal to one (1) vertical), the ground surface shall be stepped or benched to achieve this
bond. Vertical dimension of the required benches shall be as determined by the Geotechnical
Engineer, based upon location, degree, and condition of the hill slope.
5. After the foundation for the fill has been cleared and scarified, it shall be disced or bladed until it is
uniform and free from large clods, uniformly moisture conditioned to the range specified by the
Geotechnical Engineer, and compacted to not less than [refer to report -- if not recommended, use
90] percent of maximum dry density as determined by ASTM D 1557, or to such other density as may
be determined appropriate for the materials and conditions and acceptable to the Geotechnical
Engineer and the owner or his representative.
D. Fill Materials
1. Materials for fill shall consist of material approved by the Geotechnical Engineer.
2. The materials used for fill shall be free from organic matter and other deleterious substances and
shall not contain rocks, clods, lumps, or cobbles exceeding four (4) inches in greatest dimension with
not more than fifteen (15) percent larger than two and one-half (2-1/2) inches.
3. Imported materials to be used for fill shall be non-expansive [typically, have a plasticity index not
exceeding twelve (12)], shall be of maximum one (1) inch size, and shall be tested and approved by
the Geotechnical Engineer prior to commencement of grading and before being imported to the site.
4. The Contractor shall notify the Geotechnical Engineer at least four (4) working days in advance of the
Contractor's intention to import soil; shall designate the borrow area; and, shall permit the
Geotechnical Engineer to sample the borrow area for the purposes of examining the material and
performing the appropriate tests to evaluate the quality and compaction characteristics of the soil.
Compaction requirements for the material shall be based upon the characteristics of the material as
determined by the Geotechnical Engineer.
E. Placement of Fill
1. The selected fill material shall be placed in level, uniform layers (lifts) which, when compacted, shall
not exceed six (6) inches in thickness. Water shall be added to the fill, or the fill allowed to dry as
necessary to obtain fill moisture content at which compaction as specified can be achieved. Each
layer shall be thoroughly mixed during the spreading to obtain uniformity of moisture in each layer.
2. The fill material shall be compacted within the appropriate moisture content range (typically
optimum to slightly above the optimum) as determined by the Geotechnical Engineer for the soil(s)
being used.

3. Each layer of fill shall be compacted to not less than [refer to report; if not recommended, use 90]
percent of maximum dry density as determined by ASTM Test Designation D 1557. Compaction
equipment shall be of such design that it will be able to compact the fill to the specified density.
Compaction shall be accomplished while the fill material is within the specified moisture content
range. Compaction of each layer shall be continuous over its entire area and the compaction
equipment shall make sufficient trips to ensure that the required density has been obtained. No
ponding or jetting is permitted.
4. If work has been interrupted for any reason, the Geotechnical Engineer shall be notified by the
contractor at least two (2) working days prior to the intended resumption of grading.
F. Geotechnical Engineer
1. Owner is retaining Geotechnical Engineer to make observations and tests to determine general
compliance with Plans and Specifications, to verify expected or unexpected variations in subsurface
conditions, and to give assistance in appropriate decisions. Cost of Geotechnical Engineer will be
borne by the Owner, except costs incurred for re-tests and/or re-observations caused by failure of
the Contractor to meet specified requirements will be paid by the Owner and back charged to
Contractor.
G. Observation and Testing
1. Field density tests shall be made by the Geotechnical Engineer or his representative of the
compaction of each layer of fill. Density tests shall be taken in the compacted material below any
surfaces disturbed by the construction equipment. When these tests indicate that the density of any
layer of fill or portion thereof is below the required density or moisture content, the particular layer
or portion shall be reworked until the required density or moisture content has been obtained.
2. All aspects of the site earthwork shall be observed and tested as deemed necessary by the
Geotechnical Engineer or his representative so that he can render a professional opinion of the
completed fill for substantial compliance with plans and specifications and design concepts. The
grading contractor shall give the Geotechnical Engineer at least two (2) working days’ notice prior to
beginning any site earthwork to allow proper scheduling of the work.
H. Seasonal Limits
1. No fill material shall be placed, spread, or compacted during unfavorable weather conditions. When
work is interrupted by heavy rain, fill operations shall not be resumed until the Geotechnical Engineer
or his representative indicates that the moisture content and density of the previously placed fill are
as specified.
