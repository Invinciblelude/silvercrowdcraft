## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PROJECT IS UNPROFITABLE AT ALL PRICE POINTS

Even in the **OPTIMISTIC** scenario with:
- Highest sale prices ($460K half-plex, $410K SFR)
- Lowest construction costs ($130/SF)
- Everything goes perfectly

**Result: Still loses $318,706 (-9.6% ROI)**

---

## üí° PATHS TO PROFITABILITY

### Option 1: Negotiate Land Price Down
**Target Purchase Price: $150,000 or less**
- Saves: $108,500
- New Realistic ROI: ~0-2% (barely breakeven)

### Option 2: Increase Sale Prices Significantly
**Requires: $490K+ per half-plex, $440K+ SFR**
- Risk: Rio Linda market may not support these prices
- Need comprehensive market analysis

### Option 3: Value Engineering
- Reduce SF (smaller units)
- Simplify finishes
- Eliminate upgrades
- Target savings: $150-200K

### Option 4: Alternative Development
- Build fewer, larger homes
- Target higher-end market
- Different product mix

## üìù GEOTECHNICAL REPORT KEY FINDINGS
*(Allerion Consulting Group - March 23, 2022)*

### Site Suitability: ‚úÖ SUITABLE for residential development

### Foundation Recommendations:
- **Conventional spread footings** acceptable
- Minimum width: 12 inches for 1-story, 18 inches for 2-story
- Minimum depth: 12 inches below lowest adjacent grade
- Allowable bearing pressure: **2,000 psf**

### Soil Conditions:
- **Expansive soils present** (Low to Medium expansion potential)
- Requires proper moisture conditioning
- Post-tensioned slabs recommended for moisture protection

### Seismic:
- Site Class: D (Stiff soil)
- No liquefaction risk
- No active faults on site

### Critical Requirements:
1. Remove 12-18" of topsoil and recompact
2. All fill must be compacted to 90% relative compaction
3. Moisture conditioning required
4. Geotechnical observation during grading **MANDATORY**

### Potential Additional Costs:
- Over-excavation if unsuitable soils found: $20-40K
- Import fill material: $15-30K
- Geotechnical observation services: $15-25K
- Post-tensioned slab upgrade: $3-5/SF additional

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIMELINE ANALYSIS

### Phase 1: Permits (3-4 months)
- Building permit submittal
- Plan check
- Utility agreements
- **Risk: 2-3 months added if resubmittals required**

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (5-6 months)
- Site work
- Offsite improvements
- Onsite utilities
- **Risk: Weather delays Nov-Mar add 1-2 months**

### Phase 3: Vertical Construction (12-14 months)
- Foundations
- Framing
- MEP
- Finishes
- **Risk: Labor/material delays add 2-4 months**

### Phase 4: Sales & Closeout (3-6 months)
- Marketing
- Buyer qualification
- Escrow
- **Risk: Market absorption could take 12+ months**

**TOTAL TIMELINE: 23-30 months (2-2.5 years)**

## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. ‚ùå **DO NOT PROCEED** at $258,500 purchase price
2. üîç Conduct comprehensive market analysis for Rio Linda
3. üí∞ Negotiate purchase price to $150K maximum
4. üèóÔ∏è Obtain contractor bids for construction costs
5. üìä Analyze alternative development scenarios

### IF PROCEEDING:
1. Hire experienced general contractor with subdivision experience
2. Secure construction financing commitments
3. Pre-sell units before breaking ground
4. Budget additional 15-20% contingency
5. Plan for 30-month timeline minimum
