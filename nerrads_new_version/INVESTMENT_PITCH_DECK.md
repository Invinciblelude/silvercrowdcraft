## 2.2 REVENUE PROJECTIONS

### Market Pricing Analysis
**Submarket:** Rio Linda/North Sacramento  
**Comparable Sales (Last 6 Months):**

| Type | Size | Sale Price | $/SF | Notes |
|------|------|------------|------|-------|
| New Construction Half-Plex | 1,800 SF | $405,000 | $225 | Similar product |
| New Construction Duplex | 1,750 SF | $395,000 | $226 | 2 miles south |

**Market Challenges:**
- Rio Linda is a lower-price submarket
- Sacramento overall down 3.2% YoY
- High inventory levels = slower absorption
- Interest rates 7%+ = reduced buyer pool

### Revenue Scenarios

#### Conservative Scenario (Distressed Market)
| Unit Type | Price | Quantity | Gross Revenue | Commission (5%) | Net Revenue |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Half-Plex | $395,000 | 6 | $2,370,000 | $118,500 | $2,251,500 |
| SFR | $350,000 | 1 | $350,000 | $17,500 | $332,500 |
| **TOTALS** | | | **$2,720,000** | **$136,000** | **$2,584,000** |

#### Realistic Scenario (Current Market)

## 2.3 PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS

### Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Dev Cost | Net Revenue | Profit/(Loss) | ROI | Profit/Unit | $/SF |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|-----|-------------|------|
| **Worst Case** | $3,584,104 | $2,584,000 | **($1,000,104)** | **-27.9%** | ($142,872) | ($80) |
| **Conservative** | $3,584,104 | $2,778,750 | **($805,354)** | **-22.5%** | ($115,051) | ($65) |
| **Base Case** | $3,330,206 | $2,778,750 | **($551,456)** | **-16.6%** | ($78,779) | ($44) |
| **Upside Case** | $3,167,163 | $3,011,500 | **($155,663)** | **-4.9%** | ($22,238) | ($13) |

### üö® CRITICAL FINDING: **PROJECT IS UNPROFITABLE IN ALL SCENARIOS**

Even with:
- ‚úÖ Lowest construction costs ($130/SF)
- ‚úÖ Highest sale prices ($460K half-plex)
- ‚úÖ Perfect execution
- ‚úÖ No delays or overruns

**Result:** Still loses $155,663 (-4.9% ROI)

## 2.4 PATH TO PROFITABILITY

### Option 1: Reduce Land Acquisition Cost ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

| Land Price | Dev Cost | Revenue (Realistic) | Profit | ROI | Status |
|------------|----------|---------------------|--------|-----|--------|
| $258,500 | $3,330,206 | $2,778,750 | ($551,456) | -16.6% | ‚ùå UNPROFITABLE |
| $200,000 | $3,271,951 | $2,778,750 | ($493,201) | -15.1% | ‚ùå UNPROFITABLE |
| $150,000 | $3,221,951 | $2,778,750 | ($443,201) | -13.8% | ‚ùå UNPROFITABLE |
| **$100,000** | **$3,171,951** | **$2,778,750** | **($393,201)** | **-12.4%** | ‚ùå STILL UNPROFITABLE |
| **$50,000** | **$3,121,951** | **$2,778,750** | **($343,201)** | **-11.0%** | ‚ùå STILL UNPROFITABLE |

**Breakeven Land Price (Realistic Revenue):** Would need **NEGATIVE land price** or payment to take property!

**Breakeven Land Price (Optimistic Revenue @ $460K):**
- Need: Revenue $3,330,206 = Cost
- Net Revenue needed: $3,330,206 + $165,000 (5% commission) = $3,495,206 gross
- Per unit: $499,315
- **Half-plex would need to sell for $500K each** üö®

### Option 2: Increase Sale Prices

**Required Pricing for 10% ROI (at $258K land cost):**

| Target ROI | Required Net Revenue | Per Unit (Avg) | Half-Plex Price | SFR Price | Market Reality |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Breakeven (0%) | $3,330,206 | $475,744 | $510,000 | $440,000 | ‚ùå **UNREALISTIC** |
| 10% ROI | $3,663,227 | $523,318 | $560,000 | $485,000 | ‚ùå **IMPOSSIBLE** |
| 20% ROI | $3,996,247 | $570,892 | $612,000 | $528,000 | ‚ùå **FANTASY** |

**Rio Linda Market Reality:** New construction half-plex at $405K is top of market.

### Option 3: Reduce Construction Costs

| Construction $/SF | Total Construction | Dev Cost | Profit (Realistic) | ROI |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| $140/SF | $1,829,562 | $3,330,206 | ($551,456) | -16.6% |
| $130/SF | $1,666,519 | $3,167,163 | ($388,413) | -12.3% |
| $120/SF | $1,503,476 | $3,004,120 | ($225,370) | -7.5% |
| **$110/SF** | **$1,340,433** | **$2,841,077** | **($62,327)** | **-2.2%** |
| **$105/SF** | **$1,278,411** | **$2,779,055** | **($305)** | **0.0%** |

**Required:** $105/SF to breakeven

**Reality Check:** $105/SF is **LOW-INCOME HOUSING** cost. For market-rate duplex with:
- 2-story construction
- 4BR/2.5BA layouts
- 2-car garages
- Standard finishes

**Realistic range:** $130-160/SF in Sacramento market.

## 2.5 ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS

### Scenario A: Higher-End Product
- Upgrade finishes to luxury level
- Target $550K+ per half-plex
- **Problem:** Rio Linda market won't support luxury pricing

### Scenario B: Rental/Hold Strategy
| Metric | Half-Plex | SFR | Total |
|--------|-----------|-----|-------|
| Units | 6 | 1 | 7 |
| Monthly Rent | $2,400 | $1,900 | - |
| Annual Gross | $172,800 | $22,800 | $195,600 |
| NOI (55% expense ratio) | $95,040 | $12,540 | $107,580 |
| Value @ 6% cap | $1,584,000 | $209,000 | $1,793,000 |

**Analysis:** 
- Development cost: $3.3M
- Stabilized value: $1.8M
- **Loss: $1.5M** (-45% ROI)
- ‚ùå **WORSE than selling**

### Scenario C: Reduced Unit Count
- Build only 4 units instead of 7
- Larger lots, higher pricing
- **Problem:** Final map already approved for 7 lots (re-entitlement risk)

# 4. DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE

## 4.1 Project Schedule (Critical Path)

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative | Key Activities | Risk Level |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Phase 1: Permits** | 3-4 months | 4 months | Building permits, utility agreements | üü° MEDIUM |
| **Phase 2: Infrastructure** | 5-6 months | 10 months | Site work, offsite/onsite improvements | üî¥ HIGH |

## 5.2 Detailed Risk Analysis

### üî¥ CRITICAL RISKS

#### Risk #1: Land Price Too High
**Current Status:** At $258,500, project loses $551K  
**Breakeven Price:** Would need negative land cost  
**Mitigation:**
- Negotiate hard: Offer $150K maximum
- Walk away if seller won't negotiate
- Consider wholesaling to another developer

#### Risk #2: Construction Cost Overruns
**Current Estimate:** $1.74M (at $140/SF)  
**Variance Risk:** ¬±$300K (¬±17%)  
**Historical Data:** 68% of projects overrun by 10-20%  
**Mitigation:**
- Get 3+ competitive bids
- Fixed-price contract with GC
- Allowances for finishes (cap exposure)
- 8% contingency minimum
- Value engineering opportunities

#### Risk #3: Market Pricing Decline
**Current Trend:** -3.2% YoY  
**Projection:** Continued softness through 2025  
**Impact:** Each 5% decline = $146K revenue loss  
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-sell units (offer discounts for early commitment)
- Flexible pricing strategy
- Enhanced finishes to justify premium
- Consider rate buydowns for buyers

### üü† HIGH RISKS

#### Risk #4: Timeline Delays
**Base Case:** 26 months  
**Worst Case:** 36+ months  
**Cost Impact:** +$50K per 3-month delay  
**Common Causes:**
- Permit delays (6-8 weeks common)
- Weather (rainy season Nov-Mar)
- Inspection backlog (2-3 weeks each)
- Supply chain disruptions
- Utility company delays (PG&E)

**Mitigation:**
- Hire experienced GC with Sacramento track record
- Expedite permit through early coordination
- Material procurement locked early
- Weather contingency in schedule
- Regular utility coordination meetings

#### Risk #5: Absorption/Sales Velocity
**Target:** Sell all 7 units in 3-4 months  
**Market Reality:** 1.5-2 units/month absorption  
**Best Case:** 3.5 months  
**Worst Case:** 12+ months (if market tanks)  

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-marketing 6 months before completion
- Model home staging
- Competitive pricing
- Builder incentives (closing cost credits)
- Flexible financing options
