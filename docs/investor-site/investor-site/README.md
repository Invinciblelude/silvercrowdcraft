# Investor Site (Static)

This is a lightweight static site to present your lot-build thesis, live pipeline, market citations, process, FAQ, and an investor CTA. No backend required; deploy anywhere that serves static HTML.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page with sections (hero, pipeline, market, process, FAQ, invest)
- `styles.css` — responsive, dark theme styles
- `script.js` — renders pipeline cards and sets the footer year

## Customize
- Update brand name, email, and copy in `index.html`
- Edit pipeline items in `script.js` (title, zoning, units, links)
- Tweak colors and spacing in `styles.css`

## Compliance
- This is tombstone/educational marketing only. Do not collect funds on this site.
- For Reg CF, link the Invest CTA to your live FINRA-registered portal offering page.
- For Reg D 506(c), route to an accredited verification flow and provide offering docs off-site.
- Avoid performance promises; keep claims factual and include risks and sources.

## Deploy
- Netlify: drag-and-drop this folder; set custom domain
- GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages on `main` (root)
- Any static host (Vercel, S3/CloudFront, Firebase Hosting)

## Next Steps
- Replace `invest@yourbrand.com` with your investor inbox
- Add your logo (swap the brand text)
- Add an Updates section and post weekly photos/status
- When your portal is live, set the Portal button to the offering URL
