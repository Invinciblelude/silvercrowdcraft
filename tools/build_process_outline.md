# Build Process — Components & Categories (Generated Outline)

Use this as a checklist to map your sheets to the field sequence. After classification, we can enrich each step with sheet references found in `blueprints/classified`.

## 0. General & Site Setup
- General notes, symbols, code summaries (G-sheets)
- Site logistics plan, erosion control, access, laydown (C-sheets)
- Survey control, benchmarks, gridlines

## 1. Foundations & Subgrade (STRUCT/CIVIL)
- Excavation, trenching, over-excavation, compaction
- Footings, stem walls, grade beams; rebar schedules; anchor bolts/holdowns
- Slab prep (vapour barrier, insulation, WWM/rebar), embeds, sleeves
- Inspections and concrete placement/cure plan

## 2. Superstructure — Framing (STRUCT/ARCH)
- Sill plates, studs/walls, beams, joists, trusses
- Shearwalls, straps, nailing schedules, blocking/firestopping
- Floor/roof decking; stairs and openings framed
- Structural details and connections

## 3. Building Envelope (ARCH/DETAILS)
- WRB/air barrier; flashing; window/door installation
- Roof underlayment, penetrations, step/head wall flashings
- Exterior cladding details; moisture management

## 4. MEP Rough-in (MEP)
- Mechanical: equipment locations, ducts, supplies/returns, condensate
- Electrical: panel, homeruns, circuits, lighting/receptacle layouts
- Plumbing: water, sanitary, vent, cleanouts, slopes
- Coordination: clashes vs structure/framing; penetrations and sleeves

## 5. Insulation & Interior Close-in (ARCH/MEP)
- Insulation types/R-values; sound/fire assemblies
- Vapor control; air sealing; fire/smoke sealing
- Gypsum board types, fastening, rated wall continuity

## 6. Finishes & Fixtures (ARCH/MEP)
- Interior finishes (floor/wall/ceiling)
- Casework, doors/hardware, glazing
- Set fixtures: plumbing trims, electrical devices, mechanical registers

## 7. Exterior Site & Landscape (CIVIL/LANDSCAPE)
- Hardscape, flatwork, driveways, grading
- Utilities tie-ins; drainage; planting/irrigation

## 8. Testing, Commissioning & Closeout
- Inspections matrix and tests (pressure test, duct leakage, electrical)
- Punchlist and corrections
- As-builts, O&M, handover

Once images are indexed, we will:
1) Attach sheet references to each step (e.g., `3/A5.1 window head flashing`).
2) Extract key notes/callouts into action items.
3) Produce trade-by-trade checklists from details/schedules.
