## üîç COST REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES (PRIORITIZED)

### **üéØ HIGH IMPACT - Easy to Reduce**

#### **1. LANDSCAPING & FENCING ($148,880) ‚Üê BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY**

**Current Scope (Likely):**
- Perimeter fencing for all lots
- Front yard landscaping
- Street trees
- Irrigation systems
- Hardscaping/pavers
- Retention pond landscaping

**Why It's High:**
- $18,610 per lot in landscaping!
- Often includes "nice to have" items
- Can be phased or reduced

**Reduction Strategies:**

**Option A: Phase 1 Only (Minimize)**
```
Current:  $148,880
Reduce to: $60,000-80,000
SAVINGS:   $68,000-88,000 ‚≠ê

Include only:
- Basic erosion control
- Minimum required landscaping
- Street trees (if required)
- Retention pond basics

Remove:
- Lot perimeter fencing (buyer's responsibility)
- Front yard landscaping (buyer does it)
- Decorative hardscaping
- Irrigation beyond minimum
```

**Option B: Buyer Responsibility**
```
Current:  $148,880
Reduce to: $40,000 (minimums only)
SAVINGS:   $108,880 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Make builders responsible for:
- Lot fencing
- Front yard landscaping
- Irrigation systems

You provide only:
- Required street trees
- Erosion control
- Common area minimum
```

**Option C: Negotiate with City**
```
Work with city to reduce requirements:
- Fewer street trees
- Simpler retention pond landscaping
- Delayed timing on some items

Potential savings: $30,000-50,000
```

**RECOMMENDED: Option B**
- Savings: $108,880
- Risk: Low (standard practice)
- Buyers expect to do their own landscaping anyway

---

#### **2. CONTINGENCY (15% = $88,616) ‚Üê NEGOTIABLE**

**Current:**
- Off-site contingency: $13,326
- On-site contingency: $75,290
- **TOTAL: $88,616**

**Why It's High:**
- 15% is conservative (typical is 10%)
- Protects contractor, not you
- Negotiable if you take risk

**Reduction Strategy:**

**Option A: Reduce to 10%**
```
Current:  15% contingency = $88,616
Reduce to: 10% contingency = $59,077
SAVINGS:   $29,539 ‚≠ê

Risk: You absorb overruns
Mitigation: Fixed-price contract
```

**Option B: Reduce to 7.5%**
```
Current:  15% contingency = $88,616
Reduce to: 7.5% contingency = $44,308
SAVINGS:   $44,308 ‚≠ê‚≠ê

Risk: Higher if scope changes
Mitigation: Very detailed plans, fixed contract
```

**Option C: Owner-Contingency**
```
Remove from contract = $88,616 savings
You hold $50,000 owner contingency
Net savings: $38,616

Benefit: Only spend if needed
Risk: Contractor may bid higher
```

**RECOMMENDED: Option A (10% contingency)**
- Savings: $29,539
- Risk: Moderate
- Still have protection

---

#### **3. COMPETITIVE BIDDING ‚Üê DO THIS FIRST!**

**Why CWE Might Be High:**
- Only one estimate (no competition)
- May include preferred margins
- Could have conservative assumptions

**Strategy: Get 3+ Competitive Bids**

**Process:**
1. Take CWE plans to 3-5 other contractors
2. Request itemized bids
3. Compare line by line
4. Use lowest bid to negotiate with CWE

**Expected Savings: 10-20%**
```
If market rate is 15% lower:
$679,389 √ó 15% = $101,908 SAVINGS ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

New total: $577,481
```

**Where to Find Contractors:**
- BuildZoom.com
- Local civil engineering firms
- Ask city permit office for referrals
- REIA network
- LinkedIn Sacramento contractors

**RECOMMENDED: Absolute Must-Do!**
- Savings: $50,000-$150,000 potential
- Risk: None (just takes time)
- Essential step

---

### **üéØ MEDIUM IMPACT - Possible to Reduce**

#### **4. GRADING & PAVING ($220,894 total)**

**Current:**
- Off-site: $38,855
- On-site: $182,039
- **TOTAL: $220,894**

**Why It's High:**
- Largest single category
- Often has room for optimization

**Reduction Strategies:**

**Option A: Value Engineering**
```
Ask engineer to optimize:
- Reduce earthwork (minimize cut/fill)
- Thinner paving (if code allows)
- Simpler grading plan
- Standard vs premium materials

Potential savings: $20,000-40,000 ‚≠ê
```

**Option B: Phased Paving**
```
Some jurisdictions allow:
- Base course now
- Final paving later
- Reduces upfront cost

Potential savings: $30,000-50,000 ‚≠ê‚≠ê
(But must complete eventually)
```

**Option C: Gravel Roads (if allowed)**
```
Check if city allows:
- Gravel/chip seal instead of asphalt
- Permanent or temporary

Potential savings: $50,000-80,000 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
(Unlikely to be approved for residential)
```

**RECOMMENDED: Option A (Value Engineering)**
- Savings: $20,000-$40,000
- Risk: Low
- Engineer can optimize

---

#### **5. STORM DRAIN SYSTEM ($80,404 total)**

**Current:**
- Off-site: $4,200
- On-site: $76,204
- **TOTAL: $80,404**

**Why It Might Be Reducible:**
- Could be over-designed
- Alternative methods possible

**Reduction Strategies:**

**Option A: System Optimization**
```
Engineer reviews:
- Size pipes appropriately (not oversized)
- Minimize catch basins
- Shorter pipe runs
- Standard vs custom structures

Potential savings: $10,000-20,000 ‚≠ê
```

**Option B: Surface Drainage**
```
If site allows:
- More surface grading
- Less underground piping
- Swales instead of pipes

Potential savings: $20,000-40,000 ‚≠ê‚≠ê
```

**Option C: Alternative Systems**
```
Permeable pavement, bioswales:
- May reduce infrastructure
- Environmental benefits
- Check city approval

Potential savings: $15,000-30,000 ‚≠ê
```

**RECOMMENDED: Option A (Optimization)**
- Savings: $10,000-$20,000
- Risk: Low
- Engineer-driven

---

#### **6. WATER & SEWER SYSTEMS ($118,095 total)**

**Current:**
- Water: $42,820 + $16,155 = $58,975
- Sewer: $51,990 + $7,130 = $59,120
- **TOTAL: $118,095**

**Reduction Strategies:**

**Option A: Design Optimization**
```
Engineer reviews:
- Pipe sizing (not oversized)
- Service location efficiency
- Shared connections where possible

Potential savings: $10,000-20,000 ‚≠ê
```

**Option B: Material Substitution**
```
PVC vs other materials:
- Check acceptable materials
- Price shop pipe suppliers
- Buy in bulk/off-season

Potential savings: $8,000-15,000 ‚≠ê
```

**RECOMMENDED: Option A**
- Savings: $10,000-$20,000
- Risk: Low

---

#### **7. MISCELLANEOUS OFF-SITE ($22,500)**

**What This Includes (Likely):**
- Traffic control
- Signage
- Permits
- Testing/inspection
- Temporary facilities

**Reduction Strategies:**
```
Review line-by-line:
- DIY where possible
- Negotiate permit fees
- Minimize temporary facilities

Potential savings: $5,000-10,000 ‚≠ê
```

## üìä NEGOTIATION STRATEGIES

### **With Contractors:**

**Tactic 1: Competitive Pressure**
```
"I'm getting bids from 5 contractors. The lowest responsive 
bid will likely get the job. Can you sharpen your pencil?"
```

**Tactic 2: Scope Clarification**
```
"Your bid seems high on landscaping. What exactly is included? 
Can we reduce to just the minimum city requirements?"
```

**Tactic 3: Fixed-Price Incentive**
```
"If you can come in at $550K all-in with a fixed-price contract, 
we can start in 30 days. Any cost savings you achieve, you keep."
```

**Tactic 4: Payment Terms**
```
"I can pay 20% upfront if you can reduce your contingency from 
15% to 10%. I'll hold my own contingency fund."
```

**Tactic 5: Long-Term Relationship**
```
"This is my first subdivision, but I'm planning 2-3 more in the 
next 2 years. The contractor who does great work at fair pricing 
will get the next ones."
```

---

### **With City/Engineer:**

**Request Fee Waivers:**
```
"As a small developer, are there any fee reduction programs available?"
Potential savings: $5,000-$15,000
```

**Negotiate Requirements:**
```
"Can landscaping be deferred until certificate of occupancy?"
"Can we phase the improvements?"
"Are there alternative compliance methods?"
```

**Bundle Services:**
```
If engineer does both design and construction management:
"Can you offer a package discount for both services?"
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COST REDUCTION RISKS

### **Things NOT to Cut:**

‚ùå **Structural/Safety Items**
- Proper grading for drainage
- Adequate water/sewer sizing
- Code-required items

‚ùå **Quality That Affects Sales**
- Road quality (buyers will notice)
- Proper drainage (causes issues)
- Utility functionality

‚ùå **Required Permits/Approvals**
- All permit fees must be paid
- Required inspections
- Mandatory testing

‚ùå **Insurance/Bonding**
- Liability coverage
- Performance bonds
- Worker's comp

### **Red Flags in Bids:**

üö© **Bid is 30%+ lower than others** (too good to be true)  
üö© **Contractor has no bonding** (can't get bonded = risky)  
üö© **No itemized breakdown** (hiding details)  
üö© **Lots of TBD items** (price will go up)  
üö© **No references** (unproven contractor)  

---

## ‚úÖ EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### **Conservative Savings ($150K-200K):**
‚úÖ Get project to 80-100% ROI  
‚úÖ Increase profit by 50-60%  
‚úÖ Make deal much more attractive  
‚úÖ Easier to finance  

### **Aggressive Savings ($250K-350K):**
‚úÖ Get project to 150-200% ROI  
‚úÖ Double the profit  
‚úÖ Turn marginal deal into home run  
‚úÖ Fund next project with profits
