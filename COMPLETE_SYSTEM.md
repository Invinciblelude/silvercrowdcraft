# ✅ COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## 🎉 **DONE! Everything Fixed & Organized**

---

## 📊 **WHAT YOU NOW HAVE**

### **122 Detailed Tasks**
- Every phase broken down from start to finish
- Demo → Foundation → Framing → Roof → Exterior → MEP → Finishes → Final

### **5,536 Hours (REALISTIC)**
- **NOT 312 hours** - that was way too low
- Based on industry standards for 3,200 SF addition
- **12.2 months** with 7-person crew
- Oct 27, 2025 → Dec 10, 2026

### **Correct Blueprint Matching**
- **Sheet 07** (Proposed Floor Plan) = PRIMARY REFERENCE
- Kitchen tasks now show Sheet 07, NOT elevations
- Each task shows the right blueprints for that work
- Example:
  - Kitchen: Sheet 07 (floor plan with Tim's Island)
  - Foundation: Sheets 12, 13 (foundation plans)
  - Roof: Sheets 08, 15 (roof plans)
  - Elevations: Sheets 10, 11 (for exterior work)
